# 6. What Is The Purpose Behind Fire And Judgment?

## I. Why Judgment Frightens the Heart

For many, the word *judgment* does not arrive as good news. It arrives with a tightening in the chest, a quiet sense of dread, or a reflexive turning away. Even those who long for justice often find themselves uneasy when judgment is mentioned. Something in us recoils.

This fear is not difficult to understand. Judgment suggests exposure. It implies that what has been hidden will be seen, that what has been avoided will be named, and that what has been carried silently will no longer remain private. For people who have learned to survive by concealment, this can feel threatening rather than hopeful.

Judgment also awakens the fear of abandonment. Many imagine judgment as the moment when God finally withdraws—when patience runs out, mercy gives way to severity, and the soul is left to endure the consequences alone. In this imagination, judgment becomes separation rather than reconciliation, distance rather than nearness.

There is also the fear of pain. Fire, testing, and purification evoke images of suffering without control or relief. For those who have already endured much pain in this life, the thought of more—especially pain imposed by God—can feel unbearable. Judgment is then experienced not as healing, but as harm deferred.

These fears are not abstract. They are shaped by experience. Many have known judgment only as punishment, truth only as accusation, and exposure only as shame. In such a world, it makes sense that judgment would feel like a threat rather than a gift.

Religious language has often reinforced this fear. Judgment has been framed as the suspension of mercy, the moment when love ends and consequences begin. God is imagined as standing apart, weighing failures, and delivering sentences. Under this vision, judgment becomes the place where hope finally collapses.

Yet Scripture itself does not speak of judgment this way. The fear we carry often arises not from the biblical witness, but from a fusion of cultural punishment, moral anxiety, and images of power shaped more by fear than by love. Judgment frightens us because it has been detached from relationship and severed from healing.

Before judgment can be understood rightly, this fear must be acknowledged. Not argued against. Not corrected. Simply named. Fear has its own wisdom. It tells us where trust has been broken and where images of God have become unsafe.

This chapter does not begin by redefining judgment. It begins by listening to the fear it evokes. Only when fear is allowed to speak can truth be received as something other than threat.

Judgment frightens us because we have been taught to expect abandonment, pain without purpose, and exposure without mercy. If judgment is to become good news, these expectations must be gently unlearned—not by force, but by encountering a God whose judgment looks nothing like what we have feared.

## II. The Fear of Being Left Alone in the Fire

Beneath every fear associated with judgment lies a deeper one: the fear of being left alone. More than punishment, more than pain, more than exposure, what the heart dreads most is abandonment. The terror is not simply that judgment will hurt, but that it will hurt *without anyone remaining present*.

This fear imagines a moment when God steps back. A moment when patience gives way to distance, when mercy reaches its limit, and when the soul is handed over to suffering as though it were finally unworthy of care. In this imagination, fire becomes the place where relationship ends.

Such fear does not arise from nowhere. Many have learned, through human relationships, that love can be withdrawn when one becomes too much, too broken, or too costly. When care has been conditional in life, it is natural to assume it will be conditional in God.

Religious language has often intensified this fear. Judgment has been described as separation from God rather than encounter with God. Fire has been framed as exile rather than presence. The result is a vision of judgment as a place where God is absent and suffering is endured alone.

This fear also carries a quiet shame. It whispers that there is something about us that makes abandonment reasonable—that if everything were known, God would finally agree that we deserve to be left behind. The fire then becomes proof, not of healing, but of rejection.

At its deepest level, this fear asks a single question: *Will God remain with me when I am fully seen?*

Scripture does not answer this question by denying the seriousness of judgment. It answers it by insisting on the character of God. Again and again, God is revealed not as one who withdraws in the face of brokenness, but as one who draws nearer. The most severe moments in Scripture are often the moments of greatest divine presence, not distance.

This reframes the fear. If God does not abandon, then fire cannot mean exile. If God remains present, then judgment cannot be separation. The terror we associate with fire comes not from Scripture’s vision of God, but from a story in which suffering is endured without companionship.

Naming this fear matters. Until it is acknowledged, reassurance will sound hollow. Promises of mercy will feel conditional. Hope will remain fragile. The heart must first be allowed to say what it is afraid of losing.

The fear of being left alone in the fire is the fear that love has limits. This chapter will move slowly, not to silence that fear, but to meet it—by allowing Scripture to show what kind of God enters the fire and refuses to leave.

## III. What Fire and Judgment Are Not

Much of what frightens us about judgment arises not from Scripture itself, but from the images we have inherited. Over time, fire and judgment have been framed in ways that emphasize punishment without purpose, pain without presence, and suffering without end. These images linger in the imagination even when the heart longs for something more trustworthy.

Judgment is not divine sadism. Scripture never presents God as one who delights in suffering or who inflicts pain for its own sake. The idea that God would sustain torment simply to satisfy justice misunderstands both justice and God. Justice in Scripture is always oriented toward restoration, the setting right of what has gone wrong—not toward cruelty disguised as righteousness.

Fire is not God’s absence. One of the most damaging misconceptions is that judgment means separation from God, as though God withdraws and leaves the soul alone to suffer. Scripture consistently speaks otherwise. Fire is associated with God’s presence, not God’s retreat. To imagine fire as abandonment is to reverse the biblical story.

Judgment is not exposure for humiliation. Many fear that judgment exists to shame, to publicly display failure, or to reduce a person to their worst moments. Scripture does not describe judgment as spectacle. Truth is revealed, but it is revealed for healing. Exposure is not meant to crush the person, but to free them from what has been hidden and harmful.

Fire is not endless violence. The notion that judgment requires infinite suffering assumes that pain itself is the goal. Scripture never treats pain as an end in itself. Where fire appears, it has an effect: it refines, consumes what cannot endure, and brings clarity. Endless pain would signal failure, not faithfulness.

Judgment is not vengeance. Vengeance seeks repayment; judgment seeks restoration. Scripture repeatedly distinguishes the two. Vengeance escalates harm. Judgment interrupts it. To collapse judgment into vengeance is to confuse God’s work with human retaliation.

Fire is not the destruction of the self. The fear that judgment will erase identity or annihilate the person misunderstands what Scripture portrays as being at stake. What is threatened in judgment is not the person, but what is false, distorted, or destructive within them. Fire does not target the beloved; it targets what prevents love from being free.

These misconceptions persist because they resonate with our worst experiences of power, punishment, and shame. They feel plausible because we have seen how authority can be abused and how suffering can be made meaningless. But Scripture invites us to release these images—not because judgment is less serious than we fear, but because it is far more purposeful.

Letting go of false images of fire and judgment is not an act of denial. It is an act of trust. It clears space to encounter judgment as Scripture presents it: not as abandonment, not as cruelty, and not as endless harm, but as something that belongs within the larger work of healing and restoration.

Only when these misconceptions are gently laid down can fire be seen for what it truly is—not a threat to existence, but a passage toward truth.

## IV. Fire as Presence, Not Absence

When Scripture speaks of fire, it does so with remarkable consistency. Fire is not introduced as a sign of God’s withdrawal, but as a mark of God’s nearness. Again and again, fire accompanies moments where God draws close—where truth is revealed, where calling is clarified, and where relationship is deepened.

Moses encounters God not in silence or darkness, but in a bush that burns without being consumed (Exodus 3:2–6). The fire does not destroy the bush; it renders it holy. Moses is not abandoned to the flame; he is addressed, named, and sent. Fire here is not punishment—it is presence that awakens.

The same pattern appears as Israel journeys through the wilderness. God leads by fire at night, not to terrify, but to guide (Exodus 13:21–22). The fire does not mark danger; it marks direction. It is the sign that God is with them in uncertainty, not that they have been forsaken.

When God descends upon Sinai, fire again signals nearness (Exodus 19:18). The mountain trembles, not because God has become cruel, but because holiness disrupts what is settled and familiar. The fire reveals the seriousness of encounter, not the intent to harm. It establishes relationship, covenant, and calling.

Scripture makes this association explicit when it says, *“Our God is a consuming fire”* (Hebrews 12:29). This is not a threat appended to God’s character; it is a description of God’s nature. God’s presence consumes what cannot coexist with truth. What endures is what is real.

The prophets continue this imagery. Malachi speaks of God as a refiner’s fire, purifying silver and gold so that what remains can be offered rightly (Malachi 3:2–3). The fire is not aimed at destruction, but at refinement. The metal is not discarded; it is made fit for use. The goal is restored relationship, not loss.

The New Testament carries this forward rather than replacing it. John the Baptist speaks of a baptism with fire (Matthew 3:11, Luke 3:16). Baptism is not abandonment; it is initiation. Fire here is not exile from God, but deeper entry into God’s work. It burns away what cannot carry life forward.

At Pentecost, the Spirit descends as tongues of fire resting upon the disciples (Acts 2:3). This fire does not harm them. It empowers them. It opens speech, deepens communion, and sends them outward in love. Fire again marks presence, transformation, and participation.

Even judgment imagery follows this pattern. Paul writes that each person’s work will be tested by fire, not to annihilate the person, but to reveal what endures (1 Corinthians 3:13–15). What is false is burned away; what is true survives. And even when loss is named, the person is said to be saved—passing through fire, not abandoned to it.

Taken together, Scripture offers a consistent witness: fire is how God is near when truth matters. Fire reveals, refines, clarifies, and empowers. It does not signify God’s absence, but God’s unwillingness to remain distant from what needs healing.

This is why fire frightens us. Presence disrupts illusion. Nearness exposes what distance allows us to hide. Fire is not dangerous because God is cruel, but because truth cannot be negotiated.

If fire is presence, then judgment cannot be abandonment. If God is in the fire, then suffering is not endured alone. And if God remains present, then whatever burns is not the beloved, but what cannot live in the light of love.

Fire, in Scripture, is not the sign that God has stepped away. It is the sign that God has come close.

## V. Fire as Illuminating Light

If fire in Scripture signals God’s nearness, it also carries another closely related meaning: illumination. Fire gives light. It makes visible what was hidden, clarifies what was confused, and reveals what could not be seen in darkness. When judgment is described through fire, Scripture consistently links it to *seeing truly*, not to being harmed arbitrarily.

This connection between judgment and light appears throughout Scripture. *“God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all”* (1 John 1:5). To encounter God, then, is to encounter light—not as interrogation, but as truth unshadowed by illusion. Darkness does not flee because it is punished, but because it cannot coexist with light.

Jesus repeatedly frames judgment in these terms. *“This is the judgment: the light has come into the world”* (John 3:19). Judgment is not introduced as a future act of violence, but as a present unveiling. The crisis is not that light arrives, but that what it reveals can no longer be hidden. Judgment happens when reality is finally faced.

Fire, in this sense, is light intensified. It does not merely show what is present; it tests what is real. Paul describes this testing clearly: *“Each one’s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire”* (1 Corinthians 3:13). Fire reveals quality. What is true endures. What is false cannot survive exposure.

Importantly, the fire tests *works*, not worth. Scripture never says the person is burned away. What is evaluated is what has been built—what was constructed out of fear, self-protection, or illusion. When those structures collapse, the loss can be painful, but the person remains. *“The person will be saved, but only as through fire”* (1 Corinthians 3:15). Salvation is not negated by exposure; it is clarified through it.

The Psalms speak of this illuminating judgment as well. *“You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in the light of your presence”* (Psalm 90:8). This is not a threat. It is a recognition that nothing remains hidden before God—not because God seeks shame, but because God seeks truth. Healing requires light.

Scripture also links light with freedom. *“The truth will make you free”* (John 8:32). Freedom does not come from concealment, but from honesty made safe by love. When judgment is understood as illumination, fear begins to loosen. What is seen can be healed. What is named can be released.

This is why judgment feels frightening. Light dismantles the strategies we use to protect ourselves from pain—denial, justification, distraction, and hiding. When those defenses dissolve, the pain that was already present comes into awareness. The fire does not create the wound; it reveals it.

Seen this way, judgment is not God turning against the creature. It is God turning the lights on. And light, while sometimes uncomfortable, is always oriented toward life. Plants grow in light. Eyes are meant for light. Life flourishes where light is allowed to do its work.

Fire as illuminating light reframes judgment entirely. Judgment is not the moment God decides who is worthy. It is the moment when everything is seen as it truly is—held in the presence of a God who already knows and does not turn away.

If judgment is light, then it cannot exist for destruction alone. Light exists to reveal so that what is revealed can be made whole. Fire, in this sense, is not the enemy of love. It is one of love’s most honest expressions.

## VI. Fire That Reveals God and the Self

When fire is understood as presence and illumination, its deepest work becomes clear: it reveals. Not merely actions or outcomes, but *nature*. Fire reveals who God truly is and, in that same light, who we truly are. Judgment, then, is not affliction imposed from without, but truth unveiled from within relationship.

Scripture consistently presents revelation as the heart of judgment. When Isaiah encounters God, it is not punishment that overwhelms him, but clarity. *“Woe is me,”* he says, *“for I am a man of unclean lips”* (Isaiah 6:5). The fire does not destroy Isaiah. It clarifies him. And immediately, the same fire that reveals his need also heals it. A coal from the altar touches his lips, not to harm, but to cleanse (Isaiah 6:6–7). Revelation and restoration occur together.

This pattern repeats throughout Scripture. When God draws near, illusions fall away. Moses hides his face before the burning bush, not because God is cruel, but because truth is overwhelming when first encountered (Exodus 3:6). Yet the encounter does not end in rejection. It ends in calling. Fire reveals, then sends.

Fire also reveals the nature of God as one who remains faithful in the midst of exposure. When Scripture says that *“the LORD your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save”* (Zephaniah 3:17), it does not place judgment outside of God’s saving work. God does not alternate between judge and redeemer. Judgment is one of the ways redemption unfolds.

At the same time, fire reveals the self without the distortions that fear creates. Paul speaks of a moment when *“each one’s work will become manifest”* (1 Corinthians 3:13). What is revealed is not hidden to shame the person, but to show what has been built on truth and what has been built on fear. When false constructions fall away, the loss may feel painful—but what remains is real.

Scripture never portrays this revelation as God discovering something new about the creature. God already knows. The revelation is for the sake of the one being revealed. *“Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my thoughts”* (Psalm 139:23). This prayer is not masochistic. It is a request for freedom. To be known by God is to be released from self-deception.

Crucially, revelation happens within covenant, not outside of it. God reveals truth because God intends to remain in relationship. Exposure without love would destroy trust. Scripture never depicts God as exposing in order to abandon. Revelation is always paired with faithfulness. *“If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another”* (1 John 1:7). Light deepens communion; it does not dissolve it.

Fire reveals God as one who cannot coexist with falsehood, not because God is fragile, but because God is true. It reveals the self not as disposable, but as in need of healing. What is consumed is not the beloved, but the lie. What survives is what was always meant to live.

This is why judgment can be described as good news without contradiction. When truth is revealed in the presence of love, fear loses its power. What once had to be hidden can finally be entrusted. What was fragmented can be gathered. Fire reveals not to afflict, but to free.

In this light, judgment is not the moment God decides who to reject. It is the moment when both God and the self are seen clearly—and when the false stories that sustained fear can no longer stand.

## VII. Judgment as Birth, Not Execution

When judgment is encountered as fire and light, a final question arises: why does it hurt at all? If judgment reveals truth and heals rather than harms, why is it so often described with images of anguish, groaning, and distress?

Scripture answers this not with the language of punishment, but with the language of birth.

Again and again, moments of divine judgment are described as labor rather than death. The prophets speak of travail, of groaning, of a world straining toward something new. *“As a woman with child, who writhes and cries out in her pangs when she is near her time, so were we because of you, O LORD”* (Isaiah 26:17). The pain is real, but it is not purposeless. It signals transition.

Jesus himself adopts this imagery. When speaking of suffering, upheaval, and judgment, he says, *“All these are but the beginning of the birth pains”* (Matthew 24:8). Birth pains are not signs of failure. They are signs that something long awaited is finally arriving. Pain does not mean destruction is imminent; it means life is pressing forward.

The apostle Paul deepens this image by extending it beyond individuals to the whole of creation. *“The whole creation has been groaning in labor pains until now,”* he writes, *“and not only creation, but we ourselves…groan inwardly as we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies”* (Romans 8:22–23). Judgment here is not the end of the story. It is the pressure of transformation, the movement from what is incomplete into what is whole.

Birth imagery matters because it redefines the meaning of pain. In birth, pain is not inflicted by an enemy. It arises because the body is opening to allow life to emerge. Resistance increases pain; trust and cooperation lessen it. The pain has a direction, an end, and a purpose beyond itself.

Scripture never speaks of birth pains as endless. If pain were to continue without resolution, it would no longer be birth—it would be pathology. In the same way, judgment that did not culminate in life would not be justice. It would be failure. The presence of pain does not negate love; it confirms that love is committed to bringing something new into being.

This reframes the fear that judgment will consume rather than create. Fire, in this light, is not a furnace of destruction but the intensity of transition. What feels like loss is often the surrender of what cannot accompany us into new life. What feels like exposure is the opening through which healing enters.

Scripture holds this tension gently. *“Weeping may endure for the night, but joy comes in the morning”* (Psalm 30:5). Night is not denied. Pain is not minimized. But neither is it given the final word. Morning comes because the process is ordered toward life.

Judgment as birth also preserves dignity. The one who suffers is not a criminal being punished, but a creature being brought forth. God is not the executioner; God is the midwife—attentive, present, and unwilling to abandon the process halfway through.

Seen this way, judgment does not threaten existence. It safeguards it. It insists that what God has begun will be completed, even if the passage into fullness requires surrender and pain along the way.

Judgment is not where life is taken. It is where life finally emerges.
