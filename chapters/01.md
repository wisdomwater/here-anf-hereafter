# 1. What Does It Mean To Be Human?

## I. Why This Question Matters

Before we ask what becomes of us at the end of the story, we must ask what we are at the beginning.

Much of the fear and certainty that surround questions of immortality, judgment, and salvation do not arise from the end itself, but from assumptions we carry about what it means to be human. Are we beings who possess life by nature, or lives that are continually received? Are we finished products placed into the world, or unfinished lives invited into growth? Are we isolated centers of consciousness struggling to endure, or relational beings held within a deeper reality?

These questions are rarely named, yet they quietly shape every theological conclusion that follows. When they remain unexamined, our answers about the future often become rigid, anxious, or defensive. When they are approached gently, they open space for trust.

This chapter begins not with heaven or hell, judgment or restoration, but with anthropology—with the nature of human existence itself. Not to settle the matter quickly, but to slow us down enough to notice what the biblical story assumes before it ever describes an end.

The hope explored in this book does not rest on optimism or denial. It rests on coherence. And coherence begins by asking whether our vision of humanity aligns with the character of the God who gives us life.

If God is the source of being rather than one being among many, then human existence is not self-grounded. If our life is received rather than possessed, then endurance cannot be rooted in ourselves alone. And if we are created in the image of God, that image must be understood not as a static trait, but as a calling that unfolds over time.

To ask what it means to be human, then, is not a philosophical detour. It is the doorway through which every eschatological hope must pass.

## II. God as the Ground of Being

When we speak of God, we often imagine a being set alongside other beings—larger, stronger, more powerful, but still fundamentally comparable. The familiar image is almost unavoidable: God as a supreme actor within the universe, watching, deciding, intervening from time to time. Scripture itself sometimes speaks this way, because human language has no other starting place.

Yet beneath these images lies a deeper intuition, one that quietly reshapes everything.

God is not simply one being among many. God is that from which all being flows. Not a creature enlarged, but the source that allows creatures to exist at all. Not an object within reality, but the depth and ground of reality itself.

The biblical witness gestures toward this again and again, often without explanation. God names himself not with a description, but with being itself: *“I AM”* (Exodus 3:14). The name does not clarify—it deepens the mystery. God is not defined by what he does, but by the sheer fact that he is.

This is why Scripture can say, without strain, that *“in him we live, and move, and have our being”* (Acts 17:28). Life is not something we carry independently and occasionally offer back to God. It is something that unfolds within God’s sustaining presence. Our existence is not merely given at the beginning; it is continually held.

Seen this way, creation is not a past event but an ongoing reality. To exist at all is already to participate in God’s life. The psalms speak of this with quiet confidence: when God gives breath, creatures live; when breath is withdrawn, they return to the dust (Psalm 104:29–30). The point is not fragility for its own sake, but dependence—dependence that is neither accidental nor cruel, but intrinsic to creaturehood.

This vision of God also guards against imagining the divine as distant or detached. The One who transcends all things is also nearer than any thing. Scripture holds these together without embarrassment: God dwells in unapproachable light, yet is closer than our own thoughts; exalted beyond comprehension, yet present in every breath. Transcendence and nearness are not opposites here—they are two ways of naming the same mystery.

If God is the ground of being, then existence itself is relational at its root. Nothing stands alone. Nothing sustains itself. Everything that is, is because it is held. This does not diminish creation; it dignifies it. To be contingent is not to be disposable. It is to be received.

This is the soil in which any honest account of humanity must grow. Before we ask what kind of beings we are, or what destiny awaits us, we must recognize this first truth: our life does not originate in itself. It arises from, abides within, and returns toward the One in whom all things find their source.
