# 1. What Does It Mean To Be Human?

## I. Why This Question Matters

Before we ask what becomes of us at the end of the story, we must ask what we are at the beginning.

Much of the fear and certainty that surround questions of immortality, judgment, and salvation do not arise from the end itself, but from assumptions we carry about what it means to be human. Are we beings who possess life by nature, or lives that are continually received? Are we finished products placed into the world, or unfinished lives invited into growth? Are we isolated centers of consciousness struggling to endure, or relational beings held within a deeper reality?

These questions are rarely named, yet they quietly shape every theological conclusion that follows. When they remain unexamined, our answers about the future often become rigid, anxious, or defensive. When they are approached gently, they open space for trust.

This chapter begins not with heaven or hell, judgment or restoration, but with anthropology—with the nature of human existence itself. Not to settle the matter quickly, but to slow us down enough to notice what the biblical story assumes before it ever describes an end.

The hope explored in this book does not rest on optimism or denial. It rests on coherence. And coherence begins by asking whether our vision of humanity aligns with the character of the God who gives us life.

If God is the source of being rather than one being among many, then human existence is not self-grounded. If our life is received rather than possessed, then endurance cannot be rooted in ourselves alone. And if we are created in the image of God, that image must be understood not as a static trait, but as a calling that unfolds over time.

To ask what it means to be human, then, is not a philosophical detour. It is the doorway through which every eschatological hope must pass.

## II. God as the Ground of Being

When we speak of God, we often imagine a being set alongside other beings—larger, stronger, more powerful, but still fundamentally comparable. The familiar image is almost unavoidable: God as a supreme actor within the universe, watching, deciding, intervening from time to time. Scripture itself sometimes speaks this way, because human language has no other starting place.

Yet beneath these images lies a deeper intuition, one that quietly reshapes everything.

God is not simply one being among many. God is that from which all being flows. Not a creature enlarged, but the source that allows creatures to exist at all. Not an object within reality, but the depth and ground of reality itself.

The biblical witness gestures toward this again and again, often without explanation. God names himself not with a description, but with being itself: *“I AM”*. The name does not clarify—it deepens the mystery. God is not defined by what he does, but by the sheer fact that he is.

This is why Scripture can say, without strain, that *“in him we live, and move, and have our being”*. Life is not something we carry independently and occasionally offer back to God. It is something that unfolds within God’s sustaining presence. Our existence is not merely given at the beginning; it is continually held.

Seen this way, creation is not a past event but an ongoing reality. To exist at all is already to participate in God’s life. The psalms speak of this with quiet confidence: when God gives breath, creatures live; when breath is withdrawn, they return to the dust. The point is not fragility for its own sake, but dependence—dependence that is neither accidental nor cruel, but intrinsic to creaturehood.

This vision of God also guards against imagining the divine as distant or detached. The One who transcends all things is also nearer than any thing. Scripture holds these together without embarrassment: God dwells in unapproachable light, yet is closer than our own thoughts; exalted beyond comprehension, yet present in every breath. Transcendence and nearness are not opposites here—they are two ways of naming the same mystery.

If God is the ground of being, then existence itself is relational at its root. Nothing stands alone. Nothing sustains itself. Everything that is, is because it is held. This does not diminish creation; it dignifies it. To be contingent is not to be disposable. It is to be received.

This is the soil in which any honest account of humanity must grow. Before we ask what kind of beings we are, or what destiny awaits us, we must recognize this first truth: our life does not originate in itself. It arises from, abides within, and returns toward the One in whom all things find their source.

## III. Humanity as Contingent Life

If God is the ground of being, then human existence is, by its very nature, contingent. This is not a technical claim so much as an experiential one. We did not choose to exist. We did not bring ourselves into being. We awaken into a life already underway, sustained by conditions we neither created nor control.

Scripture speaks of this without anxiety or apology. Human life is described not as self-originating, but as formed, given, and upheld. We are shaped from the earth, animated by breath, and sustained moment by moment. Our dependence is not hidden; it is assumed. The psalms speak with calm realism about this truth, reminding us that our days are held, our limits known, and our life upheld not by our own strength, but by God’s faithfulness.

To call humanity contingent is not to say that human life is fragile in a trivial sense, or disposable in a moral one. It is to say that our existence is *received*. We are not the source of our own life, and we are not its ultimate explanation. Our being flows from beyond itself.

This runs against a deep modern instinct. We are accustomed to thinking of ourselves as autonomous selves, defined by independence, self-determination, and control. Dependence, by contrast, often feels like weakness. Yet the biblical vision never treats contingency as a defect to be overcome. It treats it as the defining feature of creaturehood.

There is a quiet humility in this perspective. To be human is not to stand alone in existence, but to stand within a gift. Life is not something we possess and defend; it is something we participate in. Every breath, every moment of awareness, every continuation of being testifies to a reality that precedes us.

This dependence does not diminish human dignity. On the contrary, it grounds it. A life that is received is not arbitrary; it is intentional. A being that depends is not meaningless; it is held. Contingency places humanity not at the center of reality, but within a larger order sustained by care rather than accident.

Seen this way, mortality itself begins to look different. Finitude is not an error introduced into an otherwise perfect system. It is part of what it means to be a creature rather than the Creator. The limits of human life are not signs of divine absence, but markers of distinction. God alone is self-existent. Everything else lives by participation.

And yet, this participation is not impersonal. The God from whom being flows is not a distant abstraction, but a living presence. Human contingency is not a mechanical dependence, like a tool relying on power. It is a relational dependence, like a life sustained by trust.

Before we speak of image, vocation, or destiny, this truth must be allowed to settle. Human life does not stand on its own. It arises from another, endures within another, and finds its meaning not in self-sufficiency, but in communion.

## IV. Breath and Image: How God Gives Life

The biblical story does not describe human life as emerging automatically from matter, nor as the result of a soul inserted into a body. Instead, it speaks of a more intimate act. Humanity is formed from the earth, and then God breathes into that form the breath of life. Only then does the human being become alive.

This image is both simple and profound. Life is not treated as a possession inherent to matter, nor as a detachable essence that can exist on its own. It is something given—something shared. Breath is the medium through which divine life animates creaturely form.

Breath is, by its nature, relational. It moves outward and inward. It cannot be hoarded or secured in advance. It must be received again and again. In this way, breath becomes a fitting symbol for contingent life. To breathe is to participate in a rhythm that precedes conscious choice, a rhythm that binds the living creature to a sustaining source.

Alongside breath, the text speaks of humanity as made in the image of God. These two ideas belong together. Breath gives life; image gives that life a particular orientation. The image of God does not function like a hidden substance buried within the human being. It names the way this living creature is shaped, directed, and called.

In the ancient world, an image was not primarily a likeness for admiration. It was a representation meant to make a presence known. Statues of kings or gods were placed in territories to signify authority, care, and governance. In Genesis, however, God does something unexpected. Rather than placing a lifeless image within creation, God forms a living one.

Humanity becomes a living image—animated by breath, capable of response, entrusted with presence. The image is not static. It moves, speaks, names, tends, and relates. It reflects not God’s power in abstraction, but God’s manner of engagement with the world.

This helps prevent a common misunderstanding. The image of God is not a badge of superiority or a metaphysical upgrade. It is not something humanity owns. It is something humanity enacts. To bear God’s image is to be oriented toward God and toward creation in a particular way—to receive life from God and to reflect God’s care outward.

Breath and image together tell a coherent story. Human beings are not self-animated icons, nor autonomous representatives. We are living forms sustained by divine life and shaped for divine purposes. Our vitality comes from God; our vocation directs us toward God.

Seen this way, the image of God is inseparable from relationship. It exists only as long as life is being received and expressed. Remove breath, and the image falls silent. Sever relationship, and the image becomes distorted. What God joins together in creation—life and orientation—cannot be meaningfully separated.

This account of humanity avoids two extremes. It does not reduce human beings to biological mechanisms sustained by impersonal forces. Nor does it elevate them into self-grounding spirits temporarily inhabiting bodies. Instead, it presents a unified picture: a living being, animated by God, bearing God’s image through participation, not possession.

Here, contingency deepens rather than diminishes meaning. Because life is given, it can be shared. Because the image is relational, it can grow. What begins in breath and image is not a finished state, but the opening movement of a story.

## V. Humanity as a Living Icon

If humanity bears the image of God, then that image must be understood not only in terms of resemblance, but of purpose. In Scripture, image is never merely descriptive; it is functional. To bear an image is to represent, to make present, to stand in for another.

In the ancient imagination, an image was placed within a domain to signify the presence and authority of the one it represented. It did not draw attention to itself. Its meaning was always outward-facing. In a similar way, humanity is placed within creation not as an end in itself, but as a living sign of God’s care, intention, and involvement with the world.

This is why the language of image is immediately followed by calling. Humanity is entrusted with naming, cultivating, and guarding the earth. These are not arbitrary tasks. They reflect God’s own manner of relating to creation—bringing order from chaos, attending to life, and sustaining what has been made. To image God is to participate in this work, not to replace God, but to reflect God.

Seen this way, the image of God is less about what humanity *is* in isolation, and more about how humanity is meant to *live*. It is a posture before God and toward the world. It is expressed through care rather than control, stewardship rather than domination. The image does not elevate humanity above creation as a detached ruler; it situates humanity within creation as a responsible participant.

Scripture consistently resists the idea that bearing God’s image is a static possession. Later texts speak of the image being renewed, clarified, and brought into fuller expression. Humanity does not simply have the image; humanity grows into it. This suggests that image is not a finished attribute, but a capacity meant to mature through relationship and practice.

The language used to describe this maturation is often relational rather than technical. To be fully human is to walk with God, to listen, to respond, to learn trust. When this relational posture breaks down, the image does not disappear, but it becomes obscured. Distortion does not erase calling; it complicates it.

Understanding humanity as a living icon also guards against a subtle temptation. If the image of God is treated as an intrinsic possession, it can become a source of pride or exclusion. If it is understood as vocation, it becomes a source of responsibility and humility. One does not boast in a calling; one seeks to live faithfully into it.

This framing also preserves hope. If the image of God is something humanity is meant to grow into, then incompleteness is not failure. It is expectation. The presence of struggle, immaturity, or distortion does not signal abandonment, but unfinished formation. What God initiates in creation, God remains committed to bringing to fullness.

The image, then, is not a frozen imprint from the past. It is a living orientation toward God’s future. Animated by breath, shaped by relationship, and expressed through care, humanity images God not by standing apart from creation, but by dwelling within it attentively and lovingly.

## VI. Existence Rooted in Relationship

If human life is contingent, animated by breath, and oriented through image, then its deepest grounding cannot be found within itself. Existence is not self-supporting. It rests in relationship.

This is where a quiet but decisive contrast emerges. There is a difference between a life that endures *by nature* and a life that endures *by relationship*. The first depends on an internal property—something indestructible, self-sustaining, sealed within itself. The second depends on communion—on being known, held, and sustained by another.

An existence rooted in itself may be durable, but it is also isolated. If a soul persists simply because it cannot cease, then relationship becomes secondary, even optional. Endurance is guaranteed, but belonging is not. In such a vision, consciousness risks becoming solitary, closed in upon itself, enduring forever without any assurance of communion.

By contrast, an existence rooted in relationship is sustained not by self-possession, but by trust. Life continues because it is given, because it is held within a faithfulness that precedes it. Endurance is not automatic; it is personal. It flows not from necessity, but from love.

Scripture consistently gestures toward this relational grounding. Human beings are said to live before God, to be known by God, to have their times held in God’s hands. Even language about breath reinforces this truth. Breath is not self-generated. It is received. It comes from beyond the self and returns beyond the self. To live by breath is already to live in relation.

This distinction has deep psychological resonance. A self-grounded existence must constantly secure itself. It must resist loss, defend boundaries, and fear interruption. A relational existence, by contrast, can rest. It does not need to justify its continuation or protect itself against annihilation. It trusts that what gave it life will also sustain it.

This helps name a fear that often remains unspoken: the fear of being alone in being. The anxiety that perhaps consciousness is sealed within itself, unaccompanied, responsible for its own endurance. Such a fear is not merely theoretical. It touches something primal. To exist without relationship is not freedom; it is isolation.

Rooting existence in relationship dissolves this terror at its root. If life is sustained by communion, then solitude is never ultimate. Separation may be real, but it is not final. Loss may wound, but it does not define the horizon of being.

Here, love proves to be a firmer foundation than nature. Nature describes what something is; love describes how something is held. A nature may persist without meaning. Love gives meaning to persistence itself. To exist because one is loved is different from existing because one must.

This does not weaken human responsibility or diminish moral seriousness. It deepens them. Relationship calls forth response. Being held invites trust. Existence grounded in love does not remove accountability; it relocates it within communion rather than fear.

If God is the ground of being, and if God’s manner of being is relational rather than solitary, then it follows that human existence finds its deepest stability not in itself, but in participation. We are sustained not because we are indestructible, but because we are not alone.

## VII. Why Love Is a Better Ground Than Nature

If existence is grounded in relationship, then love is not an added moral layer placed on top of being. It is the manner in which being itself is sustained. This distinction matters, because what grounds existence shapes how it is experienced.

An existence grounded in nature alone must rely on what it possesses internally. Its endurance depends on its own capacity to persist. Even if such a nature were indestructible, it would still be solitary. It would endure by necessity, not by meaning. Continuation would be guaranteed, but belonging would not.

By contrast, an existence grounded in love endures because it is desired. Its continuation is not automatic, but intentional. It exists because it is held within a will that affirms it. This changes the emotional and spiritual texture of existence itself. Life is no longer something to be defended, but something to be trusted.

Scripture consistently speaks of life in these relational terms. Human beings are known, called, remembered, and kept. Their worth is not tied to their capacity to endure on their own, but to God’s ongoing regard for them. Even when describing human frailty, the emphasis falls not on weakness as failure, but on dependence as truth. The security offered is not self-sufficiency, but faithfulness.

This has important psychological implications. When endurance is rooted in nature alone, anxiety is never far away. The self must constantly secure its boundaries, protect its continuity, and resist any threat to its existence. Fear becomes structural. Control becomes necessary. Trust feels dangerous.

When endurance is rooted in love, something different becomes possible. One can breathe. One can rest. The nervous system no longer bears the burden of ultimate responsibility for survival. Existence does not need to justify itself. It is justified by the relationship that sustains it.

Love also resolves a deeper fear—the fear of absolute solitude. To exist by nature alone is to risk being the only conscious center in an indifferent universe, sealed within oneself forever. To exist by love is to know that one’s life is already addressed, already received, already held in communion. Even silence is not emptiness, because presence precedes perception.

This does not mean that love removes struggle or erases suffering. It means that struggle is not interpreted as abandonment, and suffering is not mistaken for meaninglessness. Love provides a horizon within which pain can be endured without becoming ultimate.

Grounding existence in love also preserves moral seriousness without coercion. Fear-based endurance produces compliance; love-based endurance invites transformation. A life that exists because it is loved is free to grow, to repent, and to change. It does not need to protect a fixed identity at all costs. It can afford to become.

In this way, love proves to be a stronger foundation than nature. Nature explains how something continues. Love explains why it matters that it does. And when existence is sustained by love rather than by self-contained necessity, the future opens not toward endless isolation, but toward deeper communion.

## VIII. Humanity as Becoming

If human life is contingent, animated by breath, shaped by image, and sustained through relationship, then it cannot be understood as a finished state. It is better understood as a beginning. Humanity is not created complete, but *capable*. Not perfected, but *oriented*.

The biblical story quietly assumes this from the start. Creation is declared good, even very good, yet it is placed within time, movement, and growth. Humanity is situated in a garden, not a monument. A garden implies cultivation, patience, and unfolding. It presumes that what is alive will change.

This helps us see Adam differently. Adam is alive, loved, and entrusted with responsibility, but he is not yet mature. He has not yet learned discernment, trust, or wisdom. The presence of instruction itself implies development. Nothing in the story suggests that humanity begins at the summit of its potential. It begins on the path.

To say that humanity is unfinished is not to say that creation is flawed. It is to say that creation is dynamic. The image of God is given, but its fullness is grown into. Likeness unfolds through relationship, experience, and formation. What is given at once is not possession, but direction.

This vision changes how we understand failure. If humanity were meant to be static, deviation would signal collapse. But if humanity is becoming, then deviation becomes distortion rather than termination. Growth may be delayed, misdirected, or painful, but it is not thereby abandoned. The story does not end at the first fracture, because the purpose was never instant completion.

Becoming also reframes judgment, correction, and discipline. These are no longer emergency measures introduced to salvage a broken plan. They are part of formation itself. Truth must be faced for growth to occur. Illusions must be burned away for freedom to deepen. What is incomplete must be brought into coherence.

This does not diminish responsibility. It deepens it. A becoming creature is accountable precisely because it can change. Growth requires response. Love invites consent. Relationship calls for participation. Yet accountability within becoming is different from condemnation within finality. It aims at maturity, not disposal.

To see humanity as becoming also softens our fear of time. If God’s work with humanity unfolds across history, then patience is not indulgence but fidelity. The Creator who initiates life through breath does not abandon the process midway. What begins in gift moves toward fulfillment.

Here the earlier themes converge. A contingent life, grounded in love, animated by breath, and oriented through image is not meant to endure in isolation or stasis. It is meant to grow into communion. The end of the story is not survival, but fullness. Not mere continuation, but completion.

To be human, then, is not to *be* something fixed. It is to be *becoming*—held in being, shaped by relationship, and drawn toward a wholeness that lies ahead. This does not make the present insignificant. It gives it meaning. Every moment becomes part of a longer formation, sustained by a faithfulness deeper than fear.

If this is true, then the questions that follow—about death, judgment, and restoration—cannot be framed as threats to existence. They must be understood as movements within a story that God has not abandoned. What God breathes into life, God does not cease to accompany. What begins in gift is meant to end in fulfillment.
