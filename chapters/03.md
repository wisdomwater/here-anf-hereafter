## 3 - Objections Examined: The Image of God, the Breath of Life, and the Living Soul

If you have ever lingered over these words—image, breath, soul—and felt your mind tighten with questions, please know this: you are not doing anything wrong. These are not cold terms in a debate; they are human words reaching toward holy things, and they often rise up when the heart is tired, grieving, or quietly afraid.

Some have tried to turn the phrase “image of God” into a quick conclusion about immortality, as though likeness must mean sameness in every way. Yet Scripture invites a gentler reading, one that honors the height of God without shrinking the dignity of humanity. We are made in His image, yes—real, intended, meaningful—and still we are not God.

The image of God can be heard first as a blessing of worth: that a human life is not an accident, not a disposable breath in a crowded world, but a creature shaped for communion—capable of love, conscience, worship, and moral beauty. In this sense, the “image” is less a claim about what cannot die and more a witness to what is precious.

When Genesis later speaks of a son made in the “image” of his father, it gives us a quiet clue about the earlier phrase: likeness is family resemblance, not equal power. A child bears the features and the nature of the parent without carrying the parent’s full strength, history, or authority. So it may be with us and God—true resemblance, still finite.

The New Testament sometimes speaks of “image” in the language of renewal, describing a life reshaped in Christ. That matters for the soul that feels worn thin, because it suggests that God is not only the One who made us, but the One who can remake us—restoring what sin has blurred, healing what fear has fractured.

And when Scripture speaks of bearing “the image of the heavenly,” it points forward, not inward; it leans our hope toward resurrection, toward a gift God gives, rather than a possession we naturally carry. Our confidence is not that we are indestructible on our own, but that God is faithful enough to raise what has fallen asleep.

Sometimes people stumble here and ask, “But how can there be an image, if God is spirit?” The Bible’s own way of speaking does not paint God as a distant abstraction, but as personal, present, and able to reveal Himself, while still remaining beyond our grasp. We do not hold God in our hands, yet we are not left without a face to trust.

That face is Jesus. And this is where the whole question becomes tender instead of tense: if you want to know what God is like, look at Christ—His mercy, His truthfulness, His steadiness with the weak, His strength against evil, His tears at the tomb. Here is the clearest “image” we are given, and it is meant to calm the heart.

Then we come to the “breath of life,” that quiet moment in Genesis where dust becomes living. Some have read that breath as an immortal substance placed inside a body. Yet Scripture uses the same language for other breathing creatures as well, which gently cautions us not to load the phrase with more than it is meant to carry.

It may be that the Bible is showing something simpler and more humbling: that life is gift, not possession; that we are alive by receiving, not by owning; that we do not generate ourselves. Breath is precious, and breath is fragile, and our days are not held together by something in us that cannot break, but by the God who gives and sustains.

The phrase “living soul” can sound to modern ears like a hidden, separable immortal self. But in the Scriptures it often means a living being—an animated creature, a whole person alive. It is the language of life, not the language of an indestructible part.

So Genesis reads like this: God formed the man from dust, God gave the breath of life, and the man became living. Not a body plus a separate immortal passenger, but a person awakened—heart beating, lungs filling, mind perceiving, will choosing, a creature finally able to stand before God and respond.

And here, strangely, the Adventist reading can be deeply gentle to the anxious heart: it does not ask you to imagine your loved one drifting in some shadow-world, half-alive, half-away, waiting in uncertainty. It allows death to be what it feels like—an actual rest, a real silence—while placing the whole weight of hope on God’s promise to awaken the sleeping in the resurrection.

Paul’s language steadies us: immortality is not treated as the default condition of human nature, but as something God gives—something we “put on” when Christ raises the dead. This is not a colder hope; it is a warmer one, because it places our future not in a theory about what we are, but in the character of the One who loves us.
So when these phrases come close—image, breath, living soul—let them do what they were meant to do: not to provoke fear, but to invite trust. You are made with dignity. You are sustained by gift. And you are held by a faithful God, who does not misplace what He has made, and who will not forget those who sleep in Christ.
