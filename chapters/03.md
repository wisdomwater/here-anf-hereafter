## THE IMAGE OF GOD.

Dear friend, when we open the Bible and read that humanity was made “in the image of God,” it can feel like a tender honor placed on our shoulders—something meant to steady us in our smallness and remind us we are not accidents. But some have also tried to turn that phrase into a proof that we must be immortal by nature, as though God stamped eternity into us simply by calling us His likeness.

If you’ve ever heard that reasoning and felt a quiet confusion—what does “image” have to do with never dying?—you’re not alone. The Bible’s language invites reverence, but it also invites simple honesty: God’s likeness in us cannot mean that we share every attribute God possesses in the same way God possesses it. We do not carry omnipotence, omniscience, or self-existence, and so it is not careful to single out immortality as the one attribute we must have merely because the word “image” is used.

A more grounded reading is also the more comforting one: Scripture often uses “image” the way we use it in ordinary life—resemblance, likeness, a recognizable reflection. And when Genesis later says that Adam fathered a son “in his likeness, after his image,” we instinctively understand what is meant: a shared human form and a shared human nature, not an exchange of divine attributes. In the same gentle way, it is reasonable to understand that humanity bears a likeness to God in personal being—uprightness, moral capacity, relational life, and the kind of embodied existence by which love can be expressed, trust can be chosen, and obedience can be meaningful.

Some worry here: how can God have “image” if God is spirit? Yet the Scriptures speak of God in personal terms, and they speak of heavenly beings—also called spirits—as real beings who appear, act, and relate. The point is not to drag God down into our small categories, but to let the Bible speak in the plain way it speaks: God is not presented as an abstract force, but as the living Lord who sees, speaks, wills, and reveals Himself. And supremely, God has given us His clearest self-disclosure in Christ. When Scripture calls Jesus the “express image” of God’s person, it is offering us a holy reassurance: God is not unknowable mist; God has shown His face to the world in the Son.

So the “image of God” is not a brittle proof-text to win an argument; it is a steady word to help the heart rest. It tells you that your life matters, that your body matters, that your moral choices matter, and that you are made for relationship with a personal God. But it does not require us to believe that we are immortal by nature. In fact, the apostolic witness draws a distinction between God’s immortality and our mortality, and that distinction becomes part of the good news: we do not possess life in ourselves, but we are invited into life through Christ.

Scripture for further reflection: Genesis 1:26–27; Genesis 5:3; Genesis 9:6; Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:1–3; Romans 1:22–23; 1 Timothy 1:17; John 4:24

## THE BREATH OF LIFE.

When Genesis describes God forming humanity from the dust and breathing into Adam’s nostrils “the breath of life,” it is one of the most intimate lines in all of Scripture. It tells us that life is not self-generated; it is received. We are held in being by a gift. And for the weary or grieving heart, there can be comfort in that: your life is not merely a chemical accident; it is bestowed and sustained by God.

But some have tried to make that breath into something else—an argument that God inserted an immortal entity into the body, guaranteeing conscious life beyond death by nature. If that were what the text intended, we would expect the Bible to speak that way plainly. Yet the broader witness of Scripture speaks of breath as the fragile principle of life—precious, yes, but easily extinguished. The prophets and psalmists even use “breath” to humble our confidence in human strength: breath departs, and the person returns to the dust.

There is also a simple observation that steadies the matter: the Bible uses this same language of “breath of life” for the living creatures broadly, not for humanity alone. In the Flood narrative, “all flesh” is described as having the breath of life in its nostrils, and then it says that those very creatures died. If the argument is that the breath itself must be immortal, then we are forced into conclusions the Scriptures do not support—making immortality a universal possession of land animals by nature.

A more faithful and quiet reading is this: the breath of life is the animating gift of God that makes a formed body a living being. It is life as a gift, not life as a self-sustaining possession. This protects something deeply pastoral: it keeps the soul from imagining that God’s creation is a cruel trick—where humans are made unable to die, yet threatened with death. Instead, Scripture presents us as truly dependent, truly finite, and therefore truly invited to trust the One who gives life and promises to restore it.

## THE LIVING SOUL.

If you’ve been taught that the phrase “living soul” is the Bible’s way of naming an immortal, separable part inside you, it can feel unsettling to hear another possibility. So let me speak gently: we are not trying to make you smaller or strip you of hope. We are trying to let the Word of God mean what it says, so your hope can rest on something solid and kind.
Genesis says that when God formed the man from the dust and gave the breath of life, “man became a living soul.” Notice the tenderness and simplicity: it does not say God placed a conscious, independent soul into a body; it says the man became a living soul. The change described is not the addition of a second being inside the first, but the transition from lifeless to living. The human being, formed and complete in structure, receives life; the heart beats, the lungs breathe, the mind awakens—and the whole person becomes a living creature.

This matters because “living soul” is language the Bible uses for animals as well. It is a Hebrew way of speaking about an animated being—a creature with life and sensation. That doesn’t erase the real differences between humans and animals in moral capacity and God-given vocation, but it does tell us that the phrase itself is not meant to smuggle in the philosophical idea of an immortal essence that cannot die. Scripture even speaks of “living souls” dying, which should make us cautious about treating the phrase as proof of deathlessness.

Some try to place great weight on the word “became,” as though becoming a living soul must mean receiving an immortal entity that cannot be lost. But “became” in ordinary language describes entering a new condition: the acorn becomes an oak, the child becomes an adult, the still machine becomes active when power is applied. It does not normally mean that an entirely separate being was inserted into something else. And even if someone insisted that “became” signaled a change into a higher condition, it would not automatically prove that the condition must be held forever under all circumstances. Human history itself, and the Bible’s own story of sin and redemption, shows that what is given can be forfeited and what is lost can be restored.

Here is where the pastoral light begins to shine: if we are not immortal by nature, then our hope does not rest on an indestructible inner part that survives no matter what. Our hope rests on the faithfulness of God. Paul, when reflecting on Adam and Christ, points us away from self-contained immortality and toward resurrection. He speaks of the human condition as mortal and corruptible, and he points to the moment when God will clothe His people with immortality as a gift—received, not possessed by nature. That means death is taken seriously, grief is honored honestly, and yet hope remains bright because it is anchored in Christ’s victory and God’s promise to raise the dead.

So if you are afraid—afraid of what death means, afraid of being abandoned to darkness—let this be a quiet reassurance: the Bible does not ask you to find comfort in a naturally immortal self. It asks you to rest in a trustworthy Savior. The One who gave breath in the beginning is not forgetful of His creatures. He knows how to call His children back from the dust, and He has staked His own name on doing it.
