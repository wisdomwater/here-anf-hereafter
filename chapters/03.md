# Chapter 3

## 1 - The Image of God

### *What does God mean to awaken in us by calling us his “image”?*

The opening words of Genesis are spoken slowly, almost reverently, as though God wishes us to hear them before anything else is said about us:

> *“God said, ‘Let’s make man in our image, after our likeness.’”* (Genesis 1:26, WEB)

Before there is effort or failure, before obedience or estrangement, before fear ever enters the story, there is blessing. A naming. A declaration of worth. Whatever the image of God means, it is spoken over humanity before we have earned it—and before we have lost anything.

The text itself does not rush to define this image as something indestructible hidden within us. Instead, it places the language of image alongside a calling:

> *“Let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock, over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”* (Genesis 1:26, WEB)

The image appears not as a possession to be defended, but as a vocation to be lived. Humanity is entrusted with care, with responsibility, with participation in God’s good ordering of the world. Dominion here is not domination, but stewardship—authority shaped by love.

This suggests that the image of God may be less about what we *contain* and more about what we are meant to *reflect*.

A mirror does not generate light of its own. It receives light and gives it back. If the mirror cracks, the light is not destroyed—but it may scatter or dim. Still, the source remains, patient and unchanged.

Scripture itself uses the language of image in ways that feel relational rather than mechanical. A few chapters later, Genesis tells us:

> *“Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.”* (Genesis 5:3, WEB)

A child bears the image of a parent—not as an identical copy, but as a living resemblance. There is familiarity without sameness. Dependence without shame. Growth without rivalry. The likeness is real, but it unfolds over time.

So it may be with God and humanity. To be made in God’s image is not to share God’s self-existence, but to share God’s orientation toward life, love, creativity, and relationship. We resemble God not by possessing divine attributes in full, but by being shaped toward God—capable of knowing, choosing, responding, and becoming.

This is why Scripture often speaks of the image as something renewed rather than merely preserved. Paul writes of a new self that:

> *“is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator.”* (Colossians 3:10, WEB)

Renewal implies patience. Process. Care. It suggests that God is not surprised by fracture, nor deterred by distortion. The image may be obscured, but it is not abandoned.

And when Scripture lifts our eyes further still, it speaks not only of renewal, but of fulfillment. Paul dares to say:

> *“As we have borne the image of those made of dust, we will also bear the image of the heavenly.”* (1 Corinthians 15:49, WEB)

The horizon is not merely a return to beginnings, but a transformation into something fuller than what we have yet known. The image is not static. It is directional.

This movement finds its clearest expression in Christ, who is called:

> *“the image of the invisible God.”* (Colossians 1:15, WEB)

In Jesus, the image is no longer abstract. It has hands that heal. Eyes that weep. Feet that walk toward the excluded. The image of God looks like mercy embodied. Like faithfulness under pressure. Like love that does not withdraw when misunderstood or wounded.

Seen this way, the image of God is not a fragile doctrine we must protect, nor a metaphysical guarantee we must secure. It is a divine intention spoken over humanity and patiently brought to completion. It tells us who we are meant to become, not what we must fear losing.

The image does not say, *“You cannot die.”*
It says, *“You were made for God.”*

It does not insist, *“You possess life in yourself.”*
It whispers, *“You were fashioned to receive life—and to grow into its fullness.”*

And if the image is something God renews, restores, and perfects, then even our incompleteness does not threaten it. The One who first spoke dignity over dust has not forgotten the sound of his own voice.

## 2 - The Breath of Life

### *What kind of life is given when God breathes—and what does that tell us about trust?*

Genesis slows the story even further when it turns from *what* humanity is called to be, to *how* humanity comes to life. The language becomes intimate, almost tactile:

> *“Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”* (Genesis 2:7, WEB)

Here, life is not spoken into existence from a distance. It is breathed. Given at close range. The image is not of a machine switched on, but of a creature animated by nearness. Whatever the breath of life is, it is a gift received—not a possession seized.

Some have looked to this breath as proof that something deathless was placed inside the human frame. But Scripture itself invites a quieter reading. Breath, throughout the biblical witness, is fragile. It is sustaining—but it is also fleeting. It reminds us not of invulnerability, but of dependence.

The psalmist speaks plainly:

> *“Don’t put your trust in princes, nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goes forth, he returns to the earth. In that very day, his thoughts perish.”* (Psalm 146:3–4, WEB)

Breath here is not the guarantee of endless self-existence. It is the sign of a life that must be continually received. When breath departs, the creature returns to dust—not as punishment, but as truth. The ground from which we came remains part of who we are.

Ecclesiastes is even more unflinching, refusing to romanticize human life at the expense of honesty:

> *“For that which happens to the sons of men happens to animals. Even one thing happens to them. As the one dies, so the other dies. Yes, they all have one breath; and man has no advantage over animals… All go to one place. All are from the dust, and all turn to dust again.”* (Ecclesiastes 3:19–20, WEB)

This can sound unsettling if we are looking for a hidden escape hatch within ourselves. But it can also be strangely freeing. If breath is shared, then life is shared. If life is received, then none of us stands alone as a self-made being.

And Scripture confirms that this breath of life is not unique to humanity in its basic function. During the flood narrative, the same phrase appears again:

> *“They went in to Noah into the ship, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.”* (Genesis 7:15, WEB)

Later the text becomes even more explicit:

> *“All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life… died.”* (Genesis 7:22, WEB)

This does not diminish humanity. It situates us—honestly—within creation. We are not animated by a different *kind* of breath, but entrusted with a different *calling*. The breath sustains our bodies; the calling shapes our lives.

Seen this way, the breath of life does not elevate us above dependence—it reveals it. Breath reminds us that life is ongoing gift. That every inhale is borrowed. That we live not by possession, but by participation.

And yet, this is not a hopeless picture.

If breath is given, it can be given again.

If life is received, it can be renewed.

The God who breathes life into dust is not threatened by the fragility of what he has made. The same Scriptures that speak honestly about breath departing also speak of God’s faithfulness to remember his creatures. The hope of Scripture does not rest on an indestructible human essence, but on a steadfast divine love.

We are not sustained by what we *have*, but by who God *is*.

So the breath of life does not say, *“You will never die.”*
It says, *“You live because God is near.”*

It does not promise control.
It invites trust.

And if our life begins with breath freely given, then its future rests not in our grasp, but in the hands of the One who first leaned close enough to breathe.

## 3 - The Living Soul

### *What if Scripture is naming a whole living person, rather than a hidden immortal part?*

The Genesis story does not linger long over explanations. It tells us what happened, simply and reverently:

> *“Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.”* (Genesis 2:7, WEB)

The sentence does not describe a body receiving something foreign. It describes a becoming. Dust animated by breath. A formed human becoming alive. Whatever a “living soul” is, it is what the whole person becomes when life is given.

Often we read this phrase through later assumptions, imagining an invisible, independent entity inserted into a waiting body. But the text itself does not divide the human being that way. It does not say that God formed a body and then placed a soul inside it. It says that God formed *the man*—and that the man, once breathed into, *became* a living soul.

The emphasis rests on life, not on parts.

In the language of Scripture, a “living soul” is not a detachable essence. It is a living being. A breathing creature. A person in motion, sensation, awareness, and relationship. The word names vitality rather than metaphysics.

This becomes clearer when we notice that the same language is used elsewhere in Genesis for other living creatures:

> *“God said, ‘Let the waters abound with an abundance of living creatures…’”* (Genesis 1:20, WEB)
> *“God created the large sea creatures and every living creature that moves…”* (Genesis 1:21, WEB)

The phrase translated “living creature” there is the same expression rendered “living soul” when applied to humanity. Scripture is not flattening human worth by doing this. It is grounding life itself in God’s gift, not in a hierarchy of substances.

What distinguishes humanity, then, is not that we are living souls while others are not—but that we are living souls who are addressed, entrusted, and called. We are spoken to. We are named. We are invited into covenant and response.

This unified way of speaking about the human person continues throughout Scripture. When the prophets speak of souls, they speak of whole lives. When the psalms cry out, it is the *soul* that thirsts, that weeps, that hopes—not a part of us, but *us*.

Even death is spoken of honestly in this language. Revelation uses the phrase without hesitation:

> *“Every living soul died in the sea.”* (Revelation 16:3, WEB)

Whatever a living soul is, Scripture does not hesitate to say that it can die. This is not cruelty in the text. It is clarity. It prevents us from placing our hope in the wrong place.

Paul, reflecting on Genesis, speaks with the same wholeness in mind. He writes:

> *“So also it is written, ‘The first man Adam became a living soul.’ The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.”* (1 Corinthians 15:45, WEB)

Here the contrast is not between mortal bodies and immortal souls, but between two modes of life. The first is received and sustained; the second is given and overflowing. Paul goes on to say:

> *“The first man is of the earth, made of dust. The second man is the Lord from heaven.”* (1 Corinthians 15:47, WEB)

And then he names the hope—not as something humanity naturally possesses, but as something God graciously bestows:

> *“This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”* (1 Corinthians 15:53, WEB)

Immortality, in this telling, is not what we *are*. It is what we are being *led into*. It is not a hidden possession, but a promised transformation.

This changes the emotional weight of the question. If the soul were naturally immortal, then the drama of Scripture would revolve around escape. But if the soul names the whole living person, then the drama becomes one of restoration. Not flight from embodiment, but healing of it. Not abandonment of creation, but its renewal.

The phrase “living soul” does not say, *“You will never cease.”*
It says, *“You are alive because God gives life.”*

And if life is given, then its future rests not in our construction, but in God’s faithfulness.

The God who formed the human being from dust did not do so carelessly. The God who breathes life into what is formed does not abandon what he has animated. If the soul is the living person, then the promise of Scripture is not the survival of a fragment, but the redemption of the whole.

Dust is not the enemy of God.
Mortality is not beyond his reach.

The One who calls us living souls is not finished with what he has called alive.
