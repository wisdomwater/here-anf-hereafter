## 4 - Bible Use of the Terms “Immortal” and “Immortality”

It may help, before we go any farther, to pause and remember why we are here at all. We are not chasing words for their own sake, nor trying to win a point; we are listening carefully, because questions about immortality touch the places where fear, hope, grief, and trust quietly live. If the Bible truly teaches that human beings are immortal by nature, it would be reasonable to expect that it would say so plainly.

Many of us grew up surrounded by confident language about “immortal souls” and “deathless spirits,” language spoken often with sincere intent and meant to comfort those who mourn. It can feel almost disorienting, then, to set those familiar phrases gently aside and ask a simpler question: what words does Scripture itself actually use, and how does it use them?

When we look slowly and attentively, one quiet fact emerges first: the Old Testament never uses the words immortal or immortality at all. This is not an accusation or a problem to solve; it is simply an observation. The Bible that speaks so freely about life, breath, dust, days, sleep, hope, and resurrection never once describes human beings as immortal by nature.

There is, of course, one voice in the early pages of Genesis that speaks the words, “You shall not surely die.” But Scripture itself presents that voice as deceptive, not trustworthy, and it is sobering to notice that the first explicit denial of death does not come from God, but from the one who promised life while ushering in loss.

When we turn to the New Testament, some expect to find the missing declaration repeated again and again. Yet here too the language is surprisingly restrained. The word immortal appears only once in the English New Testament, and when it does, it is not spoken of human beings at all, but of God. He alone is named as immortal, eternal, invisible, and wise.

The related word often translated incorruptible appears a handful of times, and each time it points away from natural human possession and toward divine gift. It is used of God Himself, of the crown promised to the faithful, of the inheritance kept in heaven, of the resurrection body raised by God’s power, and of the transforming work of the Word and Spirit within a believing life.
This pattern is gentle but consistent. Immortality is not described as something quietly tucked inside us already; it is described as something God holds, something God promises, something God bestows. It belongs to Him, and it comes to us from Him.

Even when Scripture speaks of what is “incorruptible” in the human life, it speaks not of an indestructible essence, but of a character shaped by grace—a meek and quiet spirit that God treasures. This is not something we possess automatically; it is something we are invited to receive and grow into, like fruit ripening on a living tree.

The word immortality itself appears only a few times, and always as something sought, hoped for, or put on—not as something assumed. We are told to seek it, to await it, to receive it when God transforms what is mortal into what cannot decay. This way of speaking quietly protects us from false confidence while anchoring us in real hope.

There is something pastorally important here. If immortality were already ours by nature, then the promises of resurrection would be little more than poetic reassurances. But if immortality is God’s gift, then resurrection becomes an act of love, faithfulness, and remembrance—God calling back to life those who rest in Him.

This way of reading Scripture does not diminish the value of human life; it deepens it. We are not self-sustaining beings drifting endlessly onward. We are creatures who live by grace, rest by grace, and will be raised by grace. Our future is not secured by something hidden within us, but by Someone who knows us by name.

So when the Bible speaks carefully about immortality, it does so not to unsettle us, but to redirect our trust. Life everlasting is not an automatic possession; it is a promised gift. And the promise rests not on human nature, but on the unwavering character of God, who does not forget the dust He has lovingly shaped.
