## Bible Use of the Terms, “Immortal,” and “Immortality”

When we come to questions about life, death, and what endures, it is only natural to want firm ground beneath our feet. Scripture has long been that ground for people of faith, not as a weapon to settle arguments, but as a steady witness we return to when our hearts are tired and our minds are unsure. So it is worth pausing, gently and carefully, to notice how the Bible itself speaks when it uses words like immortal and immortality.

Many of us grew up hearing these terms spoken freely, almost casually, as though the Bible used them on every page in reference to the human soul. In moments of grief, we may have been comforted by phrases suggesting that death is not really death at all, but simply a doorway into another conscious state. Such language can feel soothing, and it often comes from a sincere desire to ease sorrow. Still, kindness asks us to look honestly at Scripture itself, to see whether these familiar expressions truly arise from its pages or whether they reflect assumptions we have inherited along the way.

When we listen closely, the Bible speaks with a surprising restraint. In the Old Testament, the words immortal and immortality do not appear at all. This silence is not harsh or neglectful; it simply invites us to notice that Scripture does not rush to define human nature in philosophical terms. The one voice that promises humanity will not truly die comes early in Genesis, but it is not God who speaks those words. That detail alone encourages a thoughtful, prayerful pause.

Turning to the New Testament, we find that the language remains careful and precise. The word immortal appears only once in our English translations, and there it is used to honor God Himself. In other passages where related language appears, it is consistently applied to God, to the future inheritance of the faithful, to the resurrected body, or to qualities shaped by God’s Spirit—never to humanity as a natural, inborn possession. The picture that emerges is not of something humans already hold securely, but of something God lovingly promises to give.

The same gentle pattern holds with the word immortality. Scripture does not describe it as something quietly residing within us, waiting to be released at death. Instead, it is spoken of as a hope set before us, something to be sought, something that must be “put on” when God completes His restoring work. Most strikingly, the Bible speaks of God as the One who alone possesses immortality in Himself, and of Christ as the One who brings life and immortality to light through the gospel. Immortality, then, is not portrayed as a human certainty, but as a divine gift, made possible through God’s faithful action on our behalf.

For a weary or grieving heart, this can actually be a word of comfort rather than loss. Our hope does not rest on fragile assumptions about what the soul can endure on its own. It rests on God’s character—on His power to give life, His willingness to save, and His promise to restore fully and finally. Life beyond death is not secured by something hidden inside us, but by the One who loves us, knows us, and will not forget us.
