## 2 - Formed by God, Made Alive by His Breath

If we want to understand what kind of beings we are, there is a simple and trustworthy place to begin: the story God Himself gives us of our creation. Scripture does not speak here in riddles or abstractions. It speaks plainly, as if God knows we need something solid to stand on when questions about life and death begin to press on our hearts.

The Bible tells us that God formed humanity from the dust of the ground. There is no shame in that. Dust is simply the material of God’s good earth, shaped by His own hands. Every part of the body was formed with care, fitted for its purpose, complete and ready. Yet, until God breathed life into that formed body, it remained still and silent. Then, with that divine breath, life awakened, and the person stood before God as a living soul.

This is an important phrase, and one worth holding gently. Scripture does not say that God placed a living soul into the body. It says that the person became a living soul. In other words, life arose from the union of what God formed and what God breathed. The whole person—body, mind, awareness, will—came into being together as a living, breathing, thinking human being.

Some have worried that this picture is too simple, that something more must have been added for thought, memory, or love to exist. But Scripture does not seem anxious about this. It is content to say that when God gives life, real life follows—life that can think, feel, choose, and respond to Him. We are not asked to explain how God accomplishes this, only to trust that He knows how to do what He has always done.

As a pastor, I have found that many fears about death come from imagining ourselves as divided beings, partly held together by something fragile or mysterious that might wander, suffer, or be lost. The creation story gently pushes us away from that fear. It presents us as whole persons whose life depends entirely on God’s sustaining breath. That dependence is not a weakness; it is our safety.

When Scripture later speaks of death, it does so using the same calm language, simply reversing the order of creation. The breath of life returns to God, and the body returns to the earth from which it was formed. Nothing violent is described. Nothing fearful is implied. The life God gave is respectfully gathered back into His keeping.

This is not meant to strip life of meaning, but to protect it. The God who knows how to awaken dust into living, thinking beings is not confused or powerless when life comes to rest. If He can form us once, He can do so again. The story of our beginning quietly reassures us about our ending.

You may notice that Scripture does not try to satisfy every curiosity or settle every philosophical question. Instead, it gives us something steadier: a picture of a faithful Creator whose ways are consistent, whose care does not waver between birth and death. For tired hearts, that consistency matters.

So if you are holding questions, or carrying grief, you need not force answers. It is enough, for now, to trust the hands that shaped you and the breath that gave you life. The same God who began your story knows how to continue it, even through the silence of the grave.
