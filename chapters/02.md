## 2 - Beginning Where Scripture Begins

#### *How do we learn what a human being truly is?*

When questions arise about death, the soul, or what lies beyond this life, there is a natural impulse to rush ahead—toward conclusions, explanations, and answers that promise certainty. But Scripture itself invites us to begin somewhere quieter.

It invites us to begin at the beginning.

Before we ask what happens when life ends, we are gently led to ask what life *is*. Before we wonder what survives death, we are asked to consider what it means to be alive at all. The Bible does not introduce humanity first through speculation, but through story. It opens not with theories of immortality, but with soil, breath, and the steady care of God.

This is not an evasion of our deepest questions. It is a grounding of them.

Genesis does not present human nature as an abstract puzzle to be solved, but as a gift to be received. We are invited to look at ourselves not as problems requiring explanation, but as creatures shaped by intention, relationship, and love. In this sense, Scripture resists both fear and overconfidence. It does not rush to explain everything, nor does it leave us without a place to stand.

> “In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.”
> *(Genesis 1:1, WEB)*

Before there is argument, there is gift.
Before there is destiny, there is belonging.

To begin here is an act of humility. It is a confession that the meaning of human life is not discovered by looking inward alone, nor by borrowing assumptions from philosophy or tradition, but by listening attentively to the story Scripture tells about our origin. This does not diminish reason or reflection; it simply places them in their proper posture—downstream from creation, not upstream from it.

The Psalms echo this posture when they say:

> “Know that Yahweh, he is God.
> It is he who has made us, and we are his.
> We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.”
> *(Psalm 100:3, WEB)*

To know ourselves truly, then, is not first to analyze our components, but to remember our Source.

When we begin where Scripture begins, we are reminded that human life is not self-originating. We did not summon ourselves into being, nor do we sustain ourselves by our own power. Our existence is derivative, received, and continually upheld. Whatever may be said later about death, judgment, or restoration, this much is already clear: life itself is a gift held in trust.

And gifts are not explained before they are received.
They are first honored.

So we begin here—not to settle every question, but to let the first question be the right one:

*What does it mean to be a creature lovingly brought into being by God?*

### Dust, Breath, and the Mystery of Becoming

#### *Genesis 2:7 and the gift of life*

After inviting us to begin at the beginning, Scripture slows the story even further. It lingers over the formation of the first human being, not in grand abstractions, but in simple, earthy language.

> “Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground,
> and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;
> and man became a living soul.”
> *(Genesis 2:7, WEB)*

There is something profoundly grounding about this image. Humanity is not introduced as a finished product dropped from heaven, nor as a spark imprisoned in matter. We are formed—shaped patiently, intentionally—from the same earth beneath our feet. The dust is not an accident or a flaw. It is the beginning place.

The text does not rush past this detail. It names it.

Dust speaks of humility, fragility, and kinship with creation. It reminds us that we belong to the world God has made, not as outsiders, but as participants. The same ground that brings forth trees and grain is the ground from which we ourselves arise. There is no hint here of contempt for the material. The forming itself is an act of care.

And yet, dust alone is not the whole story.

Into this formed body, God breathes. Life does not arise automatically, nor does it belong to the dust by right. It is given. The breath is not described as an object handed over, but as an intimate act—God leaning close, sharing life. The image is tender, almost vulnerable. Life begins not with command, but with nearness.

The text then says something quietly remarkable: *“man became a living soul.”*

It does not say that a soul was inserted, attached, or assigned. It does not describe two separate components being joined together. Instead, it describes a becoming. From dust and breath together, a living being emerges. Life, in this telling, is not a possession we carry inside ourselves. It is a condition we enter into by grace.

To be alive, then, is already to be dependent. Breath is received, not owned. Life is sustained moment by moment, not secured once and for all. This is not meant to frighten us. It is meant to locate us—within relationship, within gift, within care.

Other passages in Scripture echo this same vision. Job speaks of humanity this way:

> “The Spirit of God has made me.
> The breath of the Almighty gives me life.”
> *(Job 33:4, WEB)*

Life flows from God, and remains oriented toward God. It is not self-contained. It is not autonomous. It is held.

Read this way, Genesis is not primarily concerned with defining metaphysical categories. It is teaching us how to see ourselves. We are earth-shaped and God-breathed beings—formed, animated, and sustained by a love that does not stand at a distance.

This matters deeply for how we approach questions of death and what lies beyond it. If life begins in gift rather than possession, then whatever comes later must also be held within that same generosity. The story does not begin with self-sufficiency, and it does not invite us to imagine that it ends there either.

For now, the text asks us simply to notice:
Life is not something we *have*.
It is something we are continually *given*.

And what is given by God is never given carelessly.

### The Wholeness of the Human Person

#### *No divided selves*

One of the quiet gifts of the creation story is the way it refuses to fragment the human person. Genesis does not speak of humanity as a collection of separate parts stitched together, nor does it suggest that our true self exists somewhere other than where our life is actually lived. The language is simple, but its implications are deep.

Dust and breath together give rise to a living being. Not a body plus something else, but a life that is whole.

This wholeness matters. It shapes how we understand ourselves, our bodies, our thoughts, and even our prayers. Scripture consistently speaks of human beings as integrated lives rather than divided substances. When the Bible speaks of the soul, it is often speaking of the person as a living, breathing self—not a detachable essence hidden away inside.

The Psalms, for example, do not address the soul as a separate resident within the body, but as the person in their fullness:

> “Bless Yahweh, my soul.
> All that is within me, bless his holy name.”
> *(Psalm 103:1, WEB)*

“All that is within me.”
The language is expansive, not compartmentalized. The self that blesses God is the same self that feels, hopes, remembers, and grows tired. There is no hint here that one part of us is more “real” than another.

This integrated vision quietly resists a way of thinking that has troubled many hearts—the idea that the body is a temporary container, useful for a time but ultimately disposable. Scripture does not speak that way. The body is not a problem to be solved, nor a shell to be discarded. It is the place where life is lived, where love is learned, and where relationship takes shape.

Even the incarnation affirms this. When God chooses to meet humanity most fully, it is not by bypassing embodied life, but by entering it.

> “The Word became flesh, and lived among us.”
> *(John 1:14, WEB)*

Flesh is not portrayed as an obstacle to God’s presence. It is the very means through which that presence is made known.

This does not mean that Scripture denies mystery. It simply refuses to divide the human being into competing layers, some valued and others neglected. Thought, emotion, will, and desire all arise within the same lived reality. We grow, learn, and mature as whole persons, shaped by time, experience, and relationship.

To speak this way is not to reduce human life to something small or mechanical. On the contrary, it affirms the depth and dignity of embodied existence. Our lives are not less sacred because they are grounded in earth and breath. They are sacred precisely because God chose to meet us there.

This wholeness also prepares us for what Scripture will later say about healing and restoration. What God makes whole, God seeks to heal wholly. Redemption is never about rescuing a fragment of us while abandoning the rest. It is always about life, restored and made complete.

For now, the creation story invites us to rest in this truth:

We are not divided selves waiting to be escaped.
We are whole beings, held together by the life God gives.
