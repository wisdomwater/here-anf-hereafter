# 5. What Is Resurrection?

## I. Why Resurrection Provokes Resistance

Resurrection is often spoken of as the great hope of the Christian faith, yet many people feel an unspoken hesitation when they imagine it. The resistance is not usually theological. It is visceral. Resurrection sounds heavier than heaven, more demanding than rest, and more exposing than peace.

This reaction deserves to be taken seriously. It does not arise from unbelief, but from experience.

In this life, embodiment is frequently associated with limitation. Bodies tire. They ache. They slow us down. They betray us through illness, injury, and decline. Desire often outpaces capacity, and intention exceeds endurance. For many, the body feels less like a gift and more like a constraint. When life has been marked by pain or exhaustion, the promise of embodied existence continuing forever can feel like a threat rather than a hope.

Alongside this is a quieter fear: participation. To be embodied is to act, to affect others, to risk harm. Our actions are rarely pure. Even our best intentions are mixed with fear, self-protection, and misunderstanding. Participation now always carries moral weight, and that weight can be exhausting. The thought of returning to action, responsibility, and visibility—without the relief of rest—can provoke anxiety.

There is also the fear of exposure. Resurrection is often associated with judgment, truth, and revelation. To be raised sounds like being fully seen, with nothing hidden. In a world quick to moralize and punish, this can feel unbearable. Many would prefer to remain unseen than to risk being known and rejected.

Because of these fears, it is easy to imagine disembodied existence as preferable. Spirit feels light where body feels heavy. Interior life feels safer than public life. Rest feels kinder than participation. Over time, these intuitions can harden into theology, shaping an unspoken belief that embodiment is a temporary burden and resurrection an unfortunate necessity.

Scripture does not dismiss these instincts, but it does challenge the conclusions drawn from them. It does not deny that embodied life as we know it is marked by weakness. It does not pretend that participation is easy or that exposure is painless. What it denies is that these features belong to embodiment itself.

The resistance to resurrection, then, often reveals something important. It is not resurrection that is being rejected, but the conditions under which life is currently lived: fragility, fear, exhaustion, and shame. The dread is rooted not in God’s promise, but in wounded experience.

This is why Scripture approaches resurrection so carefully. It does not present it as the endless extension of the present life, nor as the return to bodies unchanged. It speaks instead of transformation, healing, and fulfillment. Resurrection is not described as obligation resumed, but as life made whole.

Before resurrection can be welcomed, the fears surrounding it must be named. Until then, hope will always feel ambivalent. This chapter begins here, not to argue resistance away, but to listen to it—and then to ask whether resurrection might be something other than what we have learned to fear.

## II. What Resurrection Is Not

Much of the fear surrounding resurrection comes not from what Scripture promises, but from what we imagine resurrection to be. Before we can receive the hope Scripture holds out, it is necessary to let go of images that quietly misrepresent it.

Resurrection is not the reanimation of the present body as it is now. Scripture never suggests that the weaknesses, limitations, and frailties that mark embodied life under mortality are simply carried forward indefinitely. Paul is explicit on this point. *“What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable”* (1 Corinthians 15:42). The continuity Scripture affirms is personal, not conditional. Identity remains, but limitation does not.

Resurrection is also not a return to exhaustion. The body raised is not subject to fatigue, decay, or loss. Paul contrasts weakness with power, not body with spirit. *“It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power”* (1 Corinthians 15:43). Power here does not imply domination or excess, but capacity—life able to act without being diminished by action.

Nor is resurrection a downgrade from spiritual freedom. Scripture does not imagine the spiritual as superior to the embodied. In fact, it insists that disembodied existence, however peaceful, is incomplete. Paul speaks of longing not to be unclothed, but to be further clothed (2 Corinthians 5:4). The desire is not escape from embodiment, but embodiment brought to fullness.

Resurrection is not exposure without mercy. The fear of being fully known often imagines judgment as public humiliation or rejection. Scripture consistently resists this framing. Judgment is described as truth brought into the light, but always in the presence of God’s faithfulness. *“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”* (Romans 8:1). Revelation serves healing, not rejection.

Resurrection is not eternal moral probation. It is not a continuation of life under threat, where every action risks failure or harm. Scripture does not describe resurrected life as a testing ground. It describes it as life freed from the conditions that make sin possible. *“Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more”* (Revelation 21:4). Where these are absent, the moral anxiety that governs so much of present life also falls away.

Finally, resurrection is not an afterthought. It is not a solution God devised only after death disrupted creation. Scripture presents resurrection as woven into God’s purpose from the beginning. Death is named as an intruder, an enemy to be overcome (1 Corinthians 15:26), not as the natural conclusion of embodied life. Resurrection is God’s answer to death, not God’s concession to it.

By naming what resurrection is not, Scripture clears space for a different vision to emerge. Resurrection is not the endless continuation of what we now endure. It is not obligation resumed under the same conditions. It is not exposure without grace or participation without safety.

What resurrection is must be understood on its own terms, not as an extension of present fear. Only then can it be received as good news rather than threat.

## III. What Resurrection *Is* According to Scripture

When Scripture speaks positively about resurrection, it does so with a remarkable combination of restraint and confidence. It does not linger on mechanics or imagery, but it insists on transformation. Resurrection is not life resumed under the same conditions. It is life transfigured.

Paul’s language in 1 Corinthians 15 is especially careful. He speaks of continuity without sameness. *“What you sow does not come to life unless it dies,”* he writes, and *“what you sow is not the body that is to be”* (1 Corinthians 15:36–37). The seed and the plant are related, yet profoundly different. Identity remains, but the mode of existence is radically altered.

Scripture contrasts the present body with the resurrected body not by opposing material to spiritual, but by opposing mortality to immortality. *“It is sown a physical body; it is raised a spiritual body”* (1 Corinthians 15:44). In Paul’s usage, “spiritual” does not mean immaterial or ghostlike. It means fully animated by God’s life, no longer subject to decay, fear, or exhaustion. The body becomes transparent to the Spirit rather than resistant to it.

Resurrection, then, is embodied life saturated with God’s sustaining presence. The body no longer strains under competing forces—desire against capacity, intention against endurance. Life flows rather than resists. Action does not diminish the one who acts.

The resurrection of Jesus provides Scripture’s clearest window into this transformed embodiment. The risen Christ is recognizable and tangible. He eats, speaks, and can be touched (Luke 24:39–43; John 20:27). At the same time, he is not constrained by the same limitations. He appears where doors are shut. He is present without being confined. Continuity and transformation coexist without contradiction.

Importantly, Scripture never presents Jesus’ resurrection body as a temporary accommodation. It is the pattern. *“Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died”* (1 Corinthians 15:20). What happens to him is not an exception, but a promise. Resurrection is not symbolic; it is participatory.

This helps us understand why Scripture insists that resurrection involves the whole person. Salvation is not escape from the body, but the healing of the person in their fullness. What was fractured by death is restored. What was burdened by mortality is freed. What was unfinished is brought toward completion.

Resurrection is also described as incorruptible. *“This perishable body must put on imperishability”* (1 Corinthians 15:53). Corruption is not merely physical decay; it includes everything that distorts life—fear, shame, compulsion, and loss. Resurrection removes not only the symptoms of mortality, but its underlying fragility.

In this light, resurrection is not a return to vulnerability as we know it. It is vulnerability without threat. Presence without danger. Embodiment without decay. The body becomes a site of participation rather than limitation.

Scripture does not ask us to imagine resurrection fully. It asks us to trust that what God raises is not diminished by being embodied, but fulfilled. Resurrection is life finally able to bear its own weight.

## IV. Why Embodiment Is Essential to Fulfillment

If resurrection is truly transformed embodiment rather than a return to weakness, a deeper question still remains: why must fulfillment be embodied at all? Why does Scripture insist that life’s completion involves bodies, places, and a renewed world rather than a purely interior or spiritual existence?

Scripture’s answer begins with creation itself. From the opening pages, embodied life is not treated as a provisional stage to be discarded, but as the very arena in which God’s purposes unfold. The world is spoken into being, shaped, filled, and called good. Human beings are formed from the earth and animated by God’s breath, not as a compromise, but as an intention. Embodiment is the means by which humanity belongs to creation and participates in its care.

This is why Scripture never frames salvation as extraction from the material world. Even when it speaks of rescue, it speaks in the language of healing, restoration, and renewal. Creation is wounded, but it is not rejected. Paul describes creation as groaning, not because it longs to be erased, but because it awaits liberation and renewal (Romans 8:19–21). Fulfillment is pictured not as departure, but as transformation.

Embodiment matters because love requires form. Love is not merely an inner disposition; it is expressed through presence, action, and shared life. To care for another is to give time, attention, and oneself in ways that are necessarily embodied. Without bodies, love cannot take shape in the world God has made. Disembodied existence may preserve relationship, but it cannot complete it.

Scripture consistently affirms this by tying resurrection to vocation. The hope held out is not simply continued existence, but renewed participation in God’s life and purposes. The risen life is not static contemplation. It is life restored to meaningful action—action no longer distorted by fear, scarcity, or decay.

This also explains why the life between lives, though real and peaceful, is not the end. In that state, agency rests. Striving ceases. The soul is kept, healed, and prepared. But creation itself still waits. History still moves. God’s work of restoration still unfolds. Fulfillment requires a return to participation, not because rest has failed, but because rest was never meant to replace life.

Scripture’s insistence on resurrection, then, is an insistence that what happens in bodies matters. Love given in embodied form is not temporary or disposable. Acts of care, creativity, and faithfulness are not swallowed by time. Resurrection affirms that embodied life is not wasted, even when it is fragile or incomplete.

To deny resurrection would be to say that creation never truly arrives at its purpose—that matter, history, and particular lives ultimately dissolve into something more abstract. Scripture resists this conclusion. God does not abandon what God creates. What is begun in earth and breath is brought to completion, not set aside.

Embodiment is essential to fulfillment because fulfillment is communal, participatory, and shared. It involves renewed relationship not only with God, but with one another and with creation itself. Resurrection is the moment when life becomes fully itself—no longer burdened by mortality, but no longer disembodied either.

Fulfillment, in Scripture, is not escape from the world. It is the world made whole.
