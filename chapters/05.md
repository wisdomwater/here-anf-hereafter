# 5. What Is Resurrection?

## I. Why Resurrection Provokes Resistance

Resurrection is often spoken of as the great hope of the Christian faith, yet many people feel an unspoken hesitation when they imagine it. The resistance is not usually theological. It is visceral. Resurrection sounds heavier than heaven, more demanding than rest, and more exposing than peace.

This reaction deserves to be taken seriously. It does not arise from unbelief, but from experience.

In this life, embodiment is frequently associated with limitation. Bodies tire. They ache. They slow us down. They betray us through illness, injury, and decline. Desire often outpaces capacity, and intention exceeds endurance. For many, the body feels less like a gift and more like a constraint. When life has been marked by pain or exhaustion, the promise of embodied existence continuing forever can feel like a threat rather than a hope.

Alongside this is a quieter fear: participation. To be embodied is to act, to affect others, to risk harm. Our actions are rarely pure. Even our best intentions are mixed with fear, self-protection, and misunderstanding. Participation now always carries moral weight, and that weight can be exhausting. The thought of returning to action, responsibility, and visibility—without the relief of rest—can provoke anxiety.

There is also the fear of exposure. Resurrection is often associated with judgment, truth, and revelation. To be raised sounds like being fully seen, with nothing hidden. In a world quick to moralize and punish, this can feel unbearable. Many would prefer to remain unseen than to risk being known and rejected.

Because of these fears, it is easy to imagine disembodied existence as preferable. Spirit feels light where body feels heavy. Interior life feels safer than public life. Rest feels kinder than participation. Over time, these intuitions can harden into theology, shaping an unspoken belief that embodiment is a temporary burden and resurrection an unfortunate necessity.

Scripture does not dismiss these instincts, but it does challenge the conclusions drawn from them. It does not deny that embodied life as we know it is marked by weakness. It does not pretend that participation is easy or that exposure is painless. What it denies is that these features belong to embodiment itself.

The resistance to resurrection, then, often reveals something important. It is not resurrection that is being rejected, but the conditions under which life is currently lived: fragility, fear, exhaustion, and shame. The dread is rooted not in God’s promise, but in wounded experience.

This is why Scripture approaches resurrection so carefully. It does not present it as the endless extension of the present life, nor as the return to bodies unchanged. It speaks instead of transformation, healing, and fulfillment. Resurrection is not described as obligation resumed, but as life made whole.

Before resurrection can be welcomed, the fears surrounding it must be named. Until then, hope will always feel ambivalent. This chapter begins here, not to argue resistance away, but to listen to it—and then to ask whether resurrection might be something other than what we have learned to fear.

## II. What Resurrection Is Not

Much of the fear surrounding resurrection comes not from what Scripture promises, but from what we imagine resurrection to be. Before we can receive the hope Scripture holds out, it is necessary to let go of images that quietly misrepresent it.

Resurrection is not the reanimation of the present body as it is now. Scripture never suggests that the weaknesses, limitations, and frailties that mark embodied life under mortality are simply carried forward indefinitely. Paul is explicit on this point. *“What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable”* (1 Corinthians 15:42). The continuity Scripture affirms is personal, not conditional. Identity remains, but limitation does not.

Resurrection is also not a return to exhaustion. The body raised is not subject to fatigue, decay, or loss. Paul contrasts weakness with power, not body with spirit. *“It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power”* (1 Corinthians 15:43). Power here does not imply domination or excess, but capacity—life able to act without being diminished by action.

Nor is resurrection a downgrade from spiritual freedom. Scripture does not imagine the spiritual as superior to the embodied. In fact, it insists that disembodied existence, however peaceful, is incomplete. Paul speaks of longing not to be unclothed, but to be further clothed (2 Corinthians 5:4). The desire is not escape from embodiment, but embodiment brought to fullness.

Resurrection is not exposure without mercy. The fear of being fully known often imagines judgment as public humiliation or rejection. Scripture consistently resists this framing. Judgment is described as truth brought into the light, but always in the presence of God’s faithfulness. *“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus”* (Romans 8:1). Revelation serves healing, not rejection.

Resurrection is not eternal moral probation. It is not a continuation of life under threat, where every action risks failure or harm. Scripture does not describe resurrected life as a testing ground. It describes it as life freed from the conditions that make sin possible. *“Death will be no more; mourning and crying and pain will be no more”* (Revelation 21:4). Where these are absent, the moral anxiety that governs so much of present life also falls away.

Finally, resurrection is not an afterthought. It is not a solution God devised only after death disrupted creation. Scripture presents resurrection as woven into God’s purpose from the beginning. Death is named as an intruder, an enemy to be overcome (1 Corinthians 15:26), not as the natural conclusion of embodied life. Resurrection is God’s answer to death, not God’s concession to it.

By naming what resurrection is not, Scripture clears space for a different vision to emerge. Resurrection is not the endless continuation of what we now endure. It is not obligation resumed under the same conditions. It is not exposure without grace or participation without safety.

What resurrection is must be understood on its own terms, not as an extension of present fear. Only then can it be received as good news rather than threat.

## III. What Resurrection *Is* According to Scripture

When Scripture speaks positively about resurrection, it does so with a remarkable combination of restraint and confidence. It does not linger on mechanics or imagery, but it insists on transformation. Resurrection is not life resumed under the same conditions. It is life transfigured.

Paul’s language in 1 Corinthians 15 is especially careful. He speaks of continuity without sameness. *“What you sow does not come to life unless it dies,”* he writes, and *“what you sow is not the body that is to be”* (1 Corinthians 15:36–37). The seed and the plant are related, yet profoundly different. Identity remains, but the mode of existence is radically altered.

Scripture contrasts the present body with the resurrected body not by opposing material to spiritual, but by opposing mortality to immortality. *“It is sown a physical body; it is raised a spiritual body”* (1 Corinthians 15:44). In Paul’s usage, “spiritual” does not mean immaterial or ghostlike. It means fully animated by God’s life, no longer subject to decay, fear, or exhaustion. The body becomes transparent to the Spirit rather than resistant to it.

Resurrection, then, is embodied life saturated with God’s sustaining presence. The body no longer strains under competing forces—desire against capacity, intention against endurance. Life flows rather than resists. Action does not diminish the one who acts.

The resurrection of Jesus provides Scripture’s clearest window into this transformed embodiment. The risen Christ is recognizable and tangible. He eats, speaks, and can be touched (Luke 24:39–43; John 20:27). At the same time, he is not constrained by the same limitations. He appears where doors are shut. He is present without being confined. Continuity and transformation coexist without contradiction.

Importantly, Scripture never presents Jesus’ resurrection body as a temporary accommodation. It is the pattern. *“Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have died”* (1 Corinthians 15:20). What happens to him is not an exception, but a promise. Resurrection is not symbolic; it is participatory.

This helps us understand why Scripture insists that resurrection involves the whole person. Salvation is not escape from the body, but the healing of the person in their fullness. What was fractured by death is restored. What was burdened by mortality is freed. What was unfinished is brought toward completion.

Resurrection is also described as incorruptible. *“This perishable body must put on imperishability”* (1 Corinthians 15:53). Corruption is not merely physical decay; it includes everything that distorts life—fear, shame, compulsion, and loss. Resurrection removes not only the symptoms of mortality, but its underlying fragility.

In this light, resurrection is not a return to vulnerability as we know it. It is vulnerability without threat. Presence without danger. Embodiment without decay. The body becomes a site of participation rather than limitation.

Scripture does not ask us to imagine resurrection fully. It asks us to trust that what God raises is not diminished by being embodied, but fulfilled. Resurrection is life finally able to bear its own weight.

## IV. Why Embodiment Is Essential to Fulfillment

If resurrection is truly transformed embodiment rather than a return to weakness, a deeper question still remains: why must fulfillment be embodied at all? Why does Scripture insist that life’s completion involves bodies, places, and a renewed world rather than a purely interior or spiritual existence?

Scripture’s answer begins with creation itself. From the opening pages, embodied life is not treated as a provisional stage to be discarded, but as the very arena in which God’s purposes unfold. The world is spoken into being, shaped, filled, and called good. Human beings are formed from the earth and animated by God’s breath, not as a compromise, but as an intention. Embodiment is the means by which humanity belongs to creation and participates in its care.

This is why Scripture never frames salvation as extraction from the material world. Even when it speaks of rescue, it speaks in the language of healing, restoration, and renewal. Creation is wounded, but it is not rejected. Paul describes creation as groaning, not because it longs to be erased, but because it awaits liberation and renewal (Romans 8:19–21). Fulfillment is pictured not as departure, but as transformation.

Embodiment matters because love requires form. Love is not merely an inner disposition; it is expressed through presence, action, and shared life. To care for another is to give time, attention, and oneself in ways that are necessarily embodied. Without bodies, love cannot take shape in the world God has made. Disembodied existence may preserve relationship, but it cannot complete it.

Scripture consistently affirms this by tying resurrection to vocation. The hope held out is not simply continued existence, but renewed participation in God’s life and purposes. The risen life is not static contemplation. It is life restored to meaningful action—action no longer distorted by fear, scarcity, or decay.

This also explains why the life between lives, though real and peaceful, is not the end. In that state, agency rests. Striving ceases. The soul is kept, healed, and prepared. But creation itself still waits. History still moves. God’s work of restoration still unfolds. Fulfillment requires a return to participation, not because rest has failed, but because rest was never meant to replace life.

Scripture’s insistence on resurrection, then, is an insistence that what happens in bodies matters. Love given in embodied form is not temporary or disposable. Acts of care, creativity, and faithfulness are not swallowed by time. Resurrection affirms that embodied life is not wasted, even when it is fragile or incomplete.

To deny resurrection would be to say that creation never truly arrives at its purpose—that matter, history, and particular lives ultimately dissolve into something more abstract. Scripture resists this conclusion. God does not abandon what God creates. What is begun in earth and breath is brought to completion, not set aside.

Embodiment is essential to fulfillment because fulfillment is communal, participatory, and shared. It involves renewed relationship not only with God, but with one another and with creation itself. Resurrection is the moment when life becomes fully itself—no longer burdened by mortality, but no longer disembodied either.

Fulfillment, in Scripture, is not escape from the world. It is the world made whole.

## V. Addressing the Fear of Limitation

For many, resistance to resurrection is rooted in a deeply embodied memory of weakness. Bodies grow tired. They carry pain. They fail to respond as we wish. Desire often exceeds capacity, and effort does not always produce strength. When life has been lived under these conditions, the thought of embodied existence continuing forever can feel less like hope and more like confinement.

Scripture does not deny this experience. It agrees that embodied life under mortality is marked by limitation. What it denies is that limitation is essential to embodiment itself.

Paul is careful to distinguish between the body as it exists under death and the body as it will exist beyond it. *“It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power”* (1 Corinthians 15:43). Weakness, in this vision, is not the defining feature of embodiment. It is a condition of mortality. What resurrection removes is not the body, but the fragility that currently governs it.

This distinction matters because much of what we associate with bodily limitation is actually the cost of decay. Fatigue, illness, slowing, and loss of responsiveness are not intrinsic to having a body. They are signs of a body subject to entropy. Resurrection promises embodiment no longer subject to breakdown, depletion, or diminishment.

Scripture’s images of resurrected life consistently point toward increased capacity rather than restriction. The risen Christ is not portrayed as weighed down by flesh. He is fully embodied and fully free—present without strain, responsive without effort, capable without exhaustion. His body does not limit his participation; it enables it.

Paul describes this transformation as putting on imperishability (1 Corinthians 15:53). The language suggests not subtraction, but addition. Something is added that makes what already exists capable of enduring fully. Strength replaces vulnerability. Stability replaces fragility. Life no longer leaks away through time.

This has important implications for how we imagine resurrected bodies. They are not returned to the conditions that once made life heavy. They are freed from those conditions entirely. Whatever form resurrected embodiment takes, Scripture insists that it is suited to unending participation rather than threatened by it.

The fear of limitation often assumes that embodiment necessarily means constraint. Scripture proposes the opposite: that embodiment, once healed, becomes the means of fullest expression. Action does not diminish the self. Movement does not lead to exhaustion. Presence does not carry the risk of collapse.

This reframing allows us to name our longing honestly. The desire for strength, energy, responsiveness, and freedom is not opposed to resurrection. It is a protest against mortality. Scripture affirms that protest by promising not endless endurance of weakness, but its abolition.

Resurrection does not trap humanity in a compromised form. It releases humanity into a mode of embodied life finally capable of bearing the weight of joy, creativity, and participation without loss. Limitation does not persist because it is not part of what God intends to keep.

The body is not redeemed by being restrained, but by being made able. Resurrection is not the eternalization of what we struggle with now. It is the fulfillment of what bodies were always meant to be: alive without fear of failing the life they are meant to live.

## VI. Addressing the Fear of Being Fully Known

Alongside the fear of bodily limitation lies a deeper and more vulnerable anxiety: the fear of being fully known. Resurrection is often imagined as a moment of complete exposure, where nothing remains hidden and every thought, action, and motive is laid bare. For those who carry shame, regret, or unspoken memories, this prospect can feel unbearable.

This fear does not arise in a vacuum. It is shaped by life in a world where being known often leads to judgment rather than understanding. Exposure here frequently results in reduction—being defined by our worst moments, our weakest impulses, or our most painful failures. In such a world, hiding becomes a form of survival.

Scripture does not dismiss this fear. Instead, it reframes what it means to be known.

The first thing Scripture insists upon is that full knowledge is not something that begins at resurrection. God already knows. *“Before a word is on my tongue, you know it completely”* (Psalm 139:4). The fear that resurrection will reveal something God has not already seen misunderstands the nature of divine knowledge. Exposure is not discovery. It is alignment with reality as it already is.

More importantly, Scripture consistently places knowing within the context of love. Paul writes that one day *“I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known”* (1 Corinthians 13:12). The order matters. Being known comes first. And it is not followed by rejection. The knowledge God has of us has never led God to withdraw.

This changes the meaning of judgment. In Scripture, judgment is not primarily punitive exposure. It is the bringing of truth into the light so that what is false, distorted, or hidden can no longer govern life. *“Everything exposed by the light becomes visible, and everything that becomes visible is light”* (Ephesians 5:13). Exposure here is transformative, not humiliating.

The fear we carry often assumes this sequence: exposure leads to rejection. Scripture proposes a different order: being held makes exposure possible. Love precedes revelation. Mercy creates the conditions in which truth can be faced without collapse.

This is why resurrection follows the life between lives. Rest comes before participation. Safety comes before action. Healing precedes full visibility. God does not raise humanity into a state of unbearable disclosure. God raises humanity into a state where nothing true can threaten belonging.

Scripture also insists that shame does not survive where love is complete. *“There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear”* (1 John 4:18). Fear here is not moral caution; it is the fear of abandonment. Resurrection does not remove memory or history, but it removes the threat that history could disqualify us from love.

Being fully known in resurrection does not mean being frozen in our worst moments. It means being seen in the light of what we were becoming all along. What is unfinished is not condemned; it is completed. What is broken is not displayed; it is healed.

The fear of being known assumes that judgment is final exposure without grace. Scripture insists the opposite: grace is what makes final truth possible. Resurrection reveals nothing that is not already held within God’s faithfulness.

To be fully known, then, is not to be reduced. It is to be released—from hiding, from self-protection, from the exhausting work of managing appearances. Resurrection does not demand that we present ourselves without flaw. It frees us from the need to be flawless in order to belong.

This is not the terror of being seen at last. It is the relief of no longer needing to hide.

## VII. Participation Without Risk

One of the deepest anxieties surrounding resurrection is the return of participation itself. To act is to affect others. To participate is to risk harm. In this life, agency is always entangled with uncertainty—limited knowledge, mixed motives, inherited wounds, and unintended consequences. Even our best efforts can cause pain. The thought of participation returning forever can therefore feel like the return of moral anxiety without end.

Scripture does not imagine resurrected life under these conditions.

The problem Scripture addresses is not participation itself, but participation under distortion. Much of what we call freedom now is exercised under fear—fear of loss, fear of rejection, fear of scarcity. Desire is conflicted. Knowledge is partial. Choice is often reactive rather than free. Scripture never treats this as the ideal form of agency.

Resurrection restores participation by healing the conditions that made harm possible in the first place.

Paul describes the resurrected life as one in which God becomes “all in all” (1 Corinthians 15:28). This does not mean the erasure of human agency, but its full alignment. When life is no longer fragmented by fear or ignorance, action no longer competes with love. Participation flows from healed desire rather than self-protection.

Scripture consistently portrays goodness in the age to come not as enforced obedience, but as natural expression. *“They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads”* (Revelation 22:4). This is not a mark of ownership, but of orientation. To see God clearly is to desire what God desires. Action follows vision.

This reframes freedom. Freedom is not the perpetual ability to choose against love. It is the capacity to live fully within it. God is portrayed as perfectly free, yet never conflicted between good and evil. Resurrection invites humanity into this same mature freedom—not freedom from goodness, but freedom for it.

Participation after resurrection is therefore no longer risky. Actions do not threaten others because the conditions that give rise to harm—scarcity, competition, insecurity—are gone. Love no longer contends with fear. Creativity no longer competes for survival. What is done builds rather than wounds because nothing needs to be defended.

This does not mean participation becomes mechanical or dull. It becomes expressive. Action is no longer evaluated by whether it avoids harm, but by how fully it shares in life. Goodness is not achieved against resistance; it is embodied without strain.

Scripture’s vision of renewed creation supports this. The world to come is not described as static perfection, but as living abundance—trees bearing fruit, nations healed, life shared freely (Revelation 22:1–2). Participation continues, but it no longer carries the weight of failure. Work becomes joy. Contribution becomes gift.

The fear that participation will always carry the risk of harm assumes that harm is an eternal possibility. Scripture insists it is not. Harm belongs to a world still fractured. Resurrection marks the healing of that fracture.

To participate without risk is not to become passive. It is to become trustworthy. Life is no longer something that must be managed carefully to avoid disaster. It is something that can be given freely because love has secured the outcome.

Resurrection does not return humanity to the anxiety of moral performance. It introduces humanity into a form of participation where goodness is no longer fragile and love no longer dangerous. Action becomes safe because the self no longer needs to protect itself.

Participation, finally healed, is no longer a burden. It is the joy of being fully alive without fear.

## VIII. Work, Creativity, and Community After Resurrection

When participation is no longer shaped by fear, scarcity, or competition, it naturally takes on a different character. Scripture does not describe resurrected life as static or inert. It speaks instead of renewed creation—alive, abundant, and shared. The question is not whether there is activity after resurrection, but what kind of activity it becomes.

Scripture consistently imagines the future not as escape from the world, but as the world healed. Images of gardens, cities, rivers, trees, and nations recur throughout its closing vision (Revelation 21–22). These are not symbols of idleness. They are symbols of ordered life, mutual dependence, and shared flourishing. Community remains, but without hierarchy or exclusion. Difference remains, but without rivalry.

Work, in this context, is no longer toil. The curse associated with labor—frustration, futility, and exhaustion—is explicitly removed (Genesis 3:17–19 contrasted with Revelation 22:3). What remains is purposeful activity freed from the anxiety of survival. Action is no longer driven by the need to secure worth or avoid loss. It becomes an expression of life rather than a defense against death.

Creativity, too, is restored. Human beings were created as makers, cultivators, and co-creators. These capacities are not abandoned at resurrection; they are redeemed. Scripture’s vision of nations bringing their glory into the renewed city (Revelation 21:24–26) suggests continuity of cultural expression—beauty, uniqueness, and shared contribution—without domination or exploitation.

Community after resurrection is marked by belonging rather than comparison. Identity is no longer secured through differentiation against others. There is no need to establish rank or status, because worth is no longer contested. Scripture’s repeated emphasis on shared inheritance and mutual participation reinforces this vision. No one’s fullness diminishes another’s.

Importantly, community does not erase individuality. Resurrection does not collapse persons into sameness. Rather, it frees individuality from fear. Difference becomes gift rather than threat. Relationship deepens because there is no longer anything to protect.

Scripture speaks of this communal life as one in which God dwells openly with humanity (Revelation 21:3). Divine presence is not mediated through anxiety or distance. God’s nearness becomes the environment in which community unfolds. Relationship with God and relationship with one another are no longer in tension; they reinforce each other.

This vision challenges many modern assumptions. We often imagine fulfillment as either solitary contemplation or endless leisure. Scripture imagines something richer: shared life, meaningful activity, and mutual delight—without the pressures that make such life fragile now.

Work without exploitation. Creativity without competition. Community without fear. These are not fantasies imposed on Scripture; they are the natural outworking of a world no longer governed by death.

Resurrection restores participation not as obligation, but as joy. Life is no longer something to manage carefully. It is something to be shared freely. In this way, fulfillment is neither passive nor frantic. It is alive, relational, and secure.
