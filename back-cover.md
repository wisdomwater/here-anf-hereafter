What happens at the end of all things—and what kind of God waits there?

*Held to the End* is a contemplative journey through life, death, judgment, and the hope of restoration, written for those who have wrestled with fear, grief, or uncertainty about the life everlasting. Rather than arguing theology, this book invites readers to consider whether the story of creation can end in a way that is faithful to the love revealed in Christ.

Moving through Scripture and human experience, this work explores mortality, resurrection, judgment, and fire—not as threats, but as part of a healing process that tells the truth without abandonment. Here, justice and mercy are not rivals, judgment serves restoration, and eternity is understood not as endless survival, but as life finally made whole.

This book is for those who are grieving, for those who long to trust God more deeply, and for those who hope that love truly has the final word. *Held to the End* offers not certainty about every mystery, but quiet assurance that the One who began this work in love will remain faithful to its completion.
