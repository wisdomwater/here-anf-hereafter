# Preface

This book did not begin as a new project. It began as a response.

It started while working through *Here and Hereafter* by Uriah Smith—a text written with deep conviction and careful attention to Scripture, yet framed within a polemical structure that reflects the concerns of its time. A relative had been reading it and found the language difficult to follow, the arguments dense, and the tone heavy. Wanting to help, I initially set out to do something modest: a retelling of the work in contemporary English, clearer in expression and more accessible in form.

But as I worked through the text, I found myself increasingly unsettled—not by the sincerity of Smith’s faith, but by the shape of the conversation itself. The work is structured to argue, to dismantle opposing views, and to arrive at firm conclusions through contrast and critique. In its context, this made sense. But I began to realize that what I was trying to offer was not clarity alone. I was looking for something more humane.

I found myself asking a different question: *What kind of hope does this leave the reader with?*

The more I attempted to translate the arguments, the more I felt constrained by them. The structure resisted gentleness. The conclusions, however carefully reasoned, did not feel spacious enough to hold the fears people actually carry—fears of abandonment, of meaninglessness, of being known and found wanting. I was not looking to replace one argument with another. I was longing for a way to speak about life, death, judgment, and eternity that could be trusted by the heart as well as the mind.

And so the project changed.

Rather than retelling *Here and Hereafter*, this book became a conversation with the questions it raises—questions about mortality, immortality, judgment, and the destiny of creation. Instead of defending a position, the aim shifted toward exploring whether the Christian story could be told in a way that remained faithful to Scripture while also offering hope that does not rely on fear.

This is not a refutation of Uriah Smith, nor a polemic against those who find his conclusions compelling. It is an acknowledgment that arguments, even sincere ones, are not always what the soul most needs. Sometimes what is needed is a different posture—a slower, more contemplative way of asking what kind of God stands behind our doctrines, and what kind of future that God is bringing into being.

This book was written for those who feel the weight of theological claims and wonder whether they can be trusted. For those who have inherited frameworks that emphasize warning over healing, certainty over compassion, and fear over rest. And for those who sense that the God revealed in Christ may be more patient, more faithful, and more restorative than they have been taught to expect.

What follows is not an argument to be won, but a journey to be taken. Scripture is engaged throughout, not as a tool for proving a point, but as a witness that invites reflection and trust. Conclusions are drawn, but they are offered gently, with room for mystery and disagreement.

This work was born out of the realization that hope cannot be argued into existence. It must be discovered—slowly, honestly, and in the presence of a God who can be trusted to finish what he begins.

If this book succeeds in anything, it will not be by persuading the reader of a particular position, but by making it possible to imagine a future where love does not fail, and where the end of the story is worthy of the One who began it.

Captured by unfailing Love,
