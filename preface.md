# **Preface**

This book began, as many important journeys do, with a conversation. Not a theological debate, but a quiet, human one—shared with family, shaped by love and loss. We spoke about those who have gone before us. Where are they now? Are they safe? Are they at rest? Do they know what is happening here? Scripture offers glimpses, images, and promises—but rarely the kind of clear answers our aching hearts want.

I do not write as someone with special insight into the unseen world. I have no visions to offer, no hidden knowledge to reveal. What I carry instead is the shared testimony of others—the faithful voices of Scripture, the reflections of saints and seekers, and the long witness of people who have wrestled with these questions before us. Like you, I stand within the mystery, listening as carefully as I can.

What I do know—what I hope beyond hope—is this: God is good. Not occasionally, not conditionally, not only when we understand the outcome. God’s goodness is not fragile, and it does not fail at the edges of death or judgment. The same love revealed in Jesus—the love that heals, restores, confronts truth, and refuses to let go—is the love that holds our past, our present, and our future.

This book is an invitation to trust that love. Not to settle every question, but to rest within a larger faithfulness. If the end of all things is held by God, then the end is not something to fear. It is a homecoming—one shaped not by our certainty, but by God’s mercy. May these pages offer you space to breathe, permission to wonder, and courage to hope that whatever lies ahead, God’s ways will always lead us home.

Resting in His hands.
